INTRODUCTION
Chapter Objective
After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• Recall important tax changes to be used for 2024 tax returns.
Note
Many of the changes/provisions affecting 2024 are from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 
2017 (TCJA) and the usual inflation adjustments. Subsequent to the TCJA, the SECURE 
Act of 2019, the American Rescue Plan Act, the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act 
of 2021, the Inflation Reduction Act, and the SECURE Act 2.0 were passed and include 
key provisions that continue to affect taxes in 2024. These changes are summarized 
here and also noted throughout the course.
This course is a general overview of federal income tax laws for individuals filing 2024 tax returns. The 
course begins with the rules for filing a tax return. The course explains who must file a return, which tax 
forms to use, when the return is due, and other general information. It will help identify which filing status 
your clients qualify for and whether the income they are receiving is taxable. The course goes on to 
explain the standard deduction, the kinds of expenses they may be able to deduct, and the various kinds 
of credits they may be able to take to reduce their tax.
Throughout  the  course  are  examples  showing  how  the  tax  law  applies  in  typical  situations.  Sample  
forms and schedules show how to report certain items on tax returns. Also, throughout the course are 
flowcharts and tables that present tax information in an easy-to-understand manner.
We start with a section on important tax changes.
I.   IMPORTANT TAX CHANGES/PROVISIONS FOR 2024
• Individual tax rates are set at 0%, 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37%.
• Increase of the standard deduction to $14,600 and $29,200 for individuals and married 
couples filing jointly, respectively (2024).
Elderly and/or blind taxpayers receive an additional standard deduction amount added to 
the basic standard deduction. The additional standard deduction for a blind taxpayer—a 
taxpayer whose vision is less than 20/200—and for a taxpayer who is age 65 or older at 
the end of the year is:

 2  •  Introduction
 ▫$1,550 for married individuals; and
 ▫$1,950 for singles and heads of household.
The additional standard deduction for taxpayers who are both age 65 or older at year-
end and blind is double the additional amount for a taxpayer who is blind (but not age 
65 or older) or age 65 (but not blind). For example, a 65 year-old single blind taxpayer 
would add $3,900 to his or her usual standard deduction: $1,950 for being age 65 plus 
$1,950 for being blind ($1,950 x 2 = $3,900). Thus, his or her standard deduction would 
be $18,500 ($14,600 + $3,900 = $18,500).
• Personal exemptions are eliminated for 2018-2025.
• Write off of state and local taxes are restricted to $10,000.
• Many itemized deductions are eliminated. The tax law eliminates itemized deductions 
for:
 ▫Unreimbursed employee expenses, such as mileage (previously deductible 
to the extent they exceeded 2% of adjusted gross income)
 ▫Tax preparation expenses
 ▫Alimony payments (see details)
 ▫Investment expenses
 ▫Miscellaneous itemized deductions
 ▫Moving expenses to move to a new job, and
 ▫Personal casualty losses (except for losses associated with special disaster 
relief legislation).
• Charitable contributions. People who itemize are allowed to deduct cash contributions 
up to 60% of their adjusted gross income, instead of 50% under prior law.
• The mortgage interest deduction. 
 ▫For  all  homeowners  with  existing  mortgages  at  12/17/2017  that  were 
taken out to buy a home, there is no change to the prior mortgage interest 
deduction.
 ▫For homeowners with new mortgages after 12/17/2017 on a first or second 
home, the home mortgage interest deduction is available for up to $750,000 
of mortgage debt.
• Medical  bills.  Medical  expenses  can  be  deducted  in  2024  for  medical  expenses 
exceeding 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income.
• Alimony - Post 2018 Divorce Agreements. Under the tax code before TCJA passage, 
alimony (but not child support) was deductible by the payer and included in the income 
of the recipient for tax purposes. Under the TCJA, that tax treatment continues only for 

 3  •  Introduction
alimony payments made pursuant to a divorce or separation agreement entered into on 
or before December 31, 2018. 
However, under TCJA, §11051 as of January 1, 2019, alimony payments are no longer 
tax deductible to the payer or includible in the income of the recipient if made under: 
a) A divorce or separation agreement entered into after December 31, 2018; or
b) A  divorce  or  separation  agreement  entered  into  on  or  before  December 
31, 2018 but modified after that date if the modified agreement specifically 
provides that the provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 will apply.
Alimony  payments  made  under  a  divorce  or  separation  agreement  entered  into  on  or  
before December 31, 2018 but paid after that date—with the exception of such payments 
made  under  a  modified  agreement  described  in  b)  above—will  continue  to  be  tax 
deductible to the payer and includible in the income of the recipient.
• Adjusted estate taxes. Estates worth up to $13.61 million per person are exempt from 
the federal estate tax in 2024. This means that married couples with estates worth up to 
$27.22 million will not be affected by the federal estate tax. These numbers are increased 
for inflation each year.
• The corporate tax rate was lowered to 21% (beginning January 1, 2018).
• Section 199A. 20% tax deduction that applies to the first $383,900 (2024) of joint 
income earned by all businesses organized as S corporations, partnerships, LLCs, and 
sole proprietorships. See detailed rules for income above this amount in chapter 28.
• Rental  Real  Estate  Safe  Harbor  for  §  199A. As discussed in Notice 2019-07, a safe 
harbor is available to individuals and owners of pass through entities. Under the safe 
harbor, a rental real estate enterprise will be treated as a trade or business for purposes 
of the QBI deduction. Taxpayers may still treat rental real estate that does not meet the 
requirements of the safe harbor as a trade or business for purposes of the QBI deduction 
if it is a section 162 trade or business. 
Solely for the purposes of section 199A, a rental real estate enterprise will be treated 
as a trade or business if the following requirements are satisfied during the taxable year 
with respect to the rental real estate enterprise: 
(A)  Separate  books  and  records  are  maintained  to  reflect  income  and 
expenses for each rental real estate enterprise; 
(B) For taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 2023, 250 or more hours 
of rental services are performed per year with respect to the rental enterprise. 
For  taxable  years  beginning  after  December  31,  2022,  in  any  three  of  the 
five  consecutive  taxable  years  that  end  with  the  taxable  year  (or  in  each 
year for an enterprise held for less than five years), 250 or more hours of 
rental  services  are  performed  per  year  with  respect  to  the  rental  real  estate  
enterprise; and 

 4  •  Introduction
(C) The taxpayer maintains contemporaneous records, including time reports, 
logs, or similar documents, regarding –
(i) hours of all services performed; 
(ii) description of all services performed; 
(iii) dates on which such services were performed; and 
(iv) who performed the services. 
The  records  must  be  made  available  for  inspection  at  the  request  of  the  IRS.  The 
contemporaneous records requirement did not apply to taxable years beginning prior to 
January 1, 2019.
• Increase to Section 179 expensing. The Section 179 maximum annual deduction limit 
is increased to $1,220,000, and increases the phase-out threshold to $3,050,000 in tax 
year 2024.
• Decrease  of  bonus  depreciation  percentage. Decreases to 60% the first-year bonus 
depreciation percentage (from the prior 80% rate) for long-term assets placed in service 
in 2024. Bonus depreciation is allowed to be used for purchases of used property, as well 
as new property.
• Computers  are  no  longer  listed  property.  Computers  are  not  classified  as  listed 
property in tax year 2024.
• Elimination  of  entertainment  and  meals  deduction.  Deductions  for  entertainment  
expenses are eliminated for tax year 2024. Businesses may still deduct 50% of the cost 
of food consumed by employees during work or travel. 
Note
IRS Notice 2018-76, issued in October 2018, indicates that meals provided during an 
entertainment event fall under the meals deduction limit, and are not considered to be 
entertainment expenses.
• Increase of business vehicle depreciation limits for 2024. The allowable depreciation 
limits for certain passenger automobiles are increased to: $12,400 for the first year in 
which the vehicle was placed in service, $19,800 for the second year, $11,900 for the 
third year, and $7,160 for the fourth and later years in the recovery period. 
If  a  taxpayer  claims  60%  bonus  depreciation,  the  greatest  allowable  passenger 
automobile depreciation is:
 ▫$20,400 for the first year;

 5  •  Introduction
 ▫$19,800 for the second year;
 ▫$11,900 for the third year; and
 ▫$7,160 for each later taxable year in the recovery period.
• Business  use  of  a  taxpayer’s  personal  vehicle.  Taxpayers  may  no  longer  deduct  
unreimbursed  employee  expenses—including  unreimbursed  expenses  related  to 
business use of a personal vehicle—as “miscellaneous itemized deductions” to the extent 
the total of such expenses exceeds 2% of his or her AGI. 
However, the 2024 alternative standard mileage rate applicable to eligible business use 
of a vehicle is 67.0 cents per mile.
• Use of a personal vehicle for charitable purposes remains at 14 cents per mile.
• Use of a taxpayer’s personal vehicle to move. Many taxpayers change their residence 
each year, and many of those taxpayer relocations involve new jobs. Prior law permitted 
a  taxpayer  to  deduct  moving expenses by car, provided the new location was at least 
50 miles farther from the taxpayer’s former home than the former main job location. The 
moving  expense  deduction  has  been suspended  and  has  made  the  moving  expense  
reimbursement taxable income.
• Alternative minimum tax exemption amount increased. The tax code provides for an 
AMTI  exemption  for  purposes  of  determining  the  alternative  minimum  tax  amount.  The  
amount of the AMTI exemption varies according to the taxpayer’s filing status and the tax 
year. The applicable AMTI exemption amounts for 2024 are as follows:
Filing StatusPhaseout of Exemption 
Amount
Alternative Minimum 
Taxable Income Exemption*
Single or Head of Household$609,350$85,700
Married Filing Jointly & Qualifying 
Surviving Spouse
 
$1,218,700
 
$133,300
Married Filing Separately$609,350$66,650
*The AMTI exemption amounts are indexed for inflation. 
The AMTI exemption amount is reduced (but not below zero) by 25 percent of the amount by which the 
taxpayer’s alternative minimum taxable income exceeds:
• $1,218,700  for  taxpayers  whose  filing  status  is  “married  filing  jointly”  or  “qualifying 
surviving spouse”; and
• $609,350 for taxpayers whose filing status is “single,” “head of household,” and “married 
filing separately.” 

 6  •  Introduction
• Limitation  on  itemized  deductions.  The  TCJA  suspended  the  phase-out  of  itemized  
deductions  for  2018  through  2025.  Accordingly,  itemized  deductions  are  unlimited 
regardless of the taxpayer’s income.
• Maximum capital gain/dividend tax rate. High-income taxpayers are subject to higher 
capital gain and qualified dividend tax rates. For tax years beginning in 2024, the long-
term capital gain and qualified dividend tax rate is 20% for married taxpayers filing jointly 
whose taxable income exceeds $583,750 and for singles whose taxable income exceeds 
$518,900.  For taxpayers in lower income tax brackets:
• The 0% rate applies to –
 ▫Single filers with income up to $47,025,
 ▫Joint filers with income up to $94,050; and
• The 15% rate applies to –
 ▫Single filers with income between $47,025 and $518,900, and
 ▫Joint filers with income between $94,050 and $583,750.
II. SUMMARY OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF 2017 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Act)—legislation generally effective for years beginning after 
12/31/17  and  before  1/1/26—made  changes  to  both  individual  and  corporate  taxation.  The  more 
significant tax changes impacting individual tax preparation and planning made by the Act include:
• Revising individual tax rates downward;
• Eliminating personal exemptions;
• Increasing the AMT exemption and the income at which AMT exemption phaseout occurs;
• Increasing the standard deduction;
• Limiting the deduction for state and local taxes;
• Reducing the mortgage debt on which mortgage interest is deductible;
• Eliminating the equity debt interest deduction except for interest on loans used to buy, 
build or substantially improve the home that secures the loan;
• Increasing the limit on the deductibility of charitable cash contributions;
• Eliminating miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to 2% of AGI limit;
• Eliminating the moving expense deduction/exclusion for other than military;
• Eliminating  the  deduction  for  alimony  payments  made  and  the  inclusion  in  income  of  
alimony payments received for agreements after 12/31/2018; 

 7  •  Introduction
• Eliminating the phaseout of itemized deductions for higher income taxpayers;
• Increasing the Child Tax Credit and making part of the credit refundable;
• Broadening the definition of eligible education expenses under §529 College Savings 
Plans to include limited annual tax-free distributions for elementary and secondary school 
tuition;
• Eliminating the recharacterization of traditional-to-Roth IRA conversions;
• Eliminating  the  individual  mandate  penalty  for  failing  to  maintain  health  coverage  
beginning in 2019; and
• Increasing the estate and gift tax exemption.
III. SECURE ACT OF 2019
The SECURE Act of 2019 was signed into law on December 20, 2019. Key provisions of the Act include 
the following:
• Removes the maximum age limits on retired contributions, formerly capped at age 70½.
• Raises the required minimum distribution age from 70½ to 72. However, the age limit for 
RMDs was raised again to 73 by the SECURE Act 2.0, discussed later.
• Allows penalty-free withdrawals of up to $5,000 from retirement plans for the birth or 
adoption of a child.
I V.  SUMMARY   OF   THE   FURTHER   CONSOLIDATED   APPROPRIA-
TIONS ACT OF 2021
The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 was signed into law on December 27, 2020.
Included below are some of the most important tax changes, extenders, and other provisions signed into 
law and extended through the end of 2023 and in some situations, even later:
• Makes the 7.5% of AGI limitation for the medical expense deduction permanent for all tax 
years beginning after December 31, 2020.
• Eliminated the tuition and fees deduction.
• Increased the modified AGI limitation for the lifetime learning credit to equal that of the 
American opportunity credit for tax years beginning after December 31, 2020. Phase-out 
ranges for both credits are $160,000 to $180,000 for married filing joint, and $80,000 to 
$90,000 for all other taxpayers.
• Extended the cancellation of qualified principal residence indebtedness exclusion from 
gross income through the end of 2025.
• Extended the residential energy efficient property credit through the end of 2023.

 8  •  Introduction
V.   SUMMARY OF THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT OF 2021
The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 was signed into law on March 11, 2021.
Included below are some of the most important tax changes, extenders, and other provisions signed into 
law and extended through the end of 2022:
• Temporarily increased the maximum exclusion for the dependent care assistance program 
to $10,500 (from $5,000) for 2021, but reverts to $5,000 for 2022 and beyond.
• For  2021  through  2025,  any  discharge  of  student  loan  debt  for  any  reason  may  be 
excluded from taxable income, as long as there is no provision for the student to provide 
services to the discharging lender.
• The premium tax credit (PTC) is a refundable credit designed to subsidize the purchase 
of health insurance through an exchange. The PTC is based on a sliding scale. The 
PTC amount is determined based on the percentage of income the cost of premiums 
represents. For tax years 2021 and 2022, an individual with household income at 300% 
of the federal poverty line (FPL) pays 6% of his or her household income for the cost of 
health insurance after receiving the credit. These percentages are indexed to the excess 
of premium growth over income growth for the preceding calendar year.
The reduction of the percentage amounts under the ARP applied for tax years beginning in 2021 and 
2022. For 2023 and beyond, the percentages reverted to the 2020 amounts as adjusted for inflation.
VI. INFLATION REDUCTION ACT
The Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law on August 16, 2022 and provides tax credits for energy 
efficient home improvements and the purchase of electric vehicles, which took effect in 2023.
VII. SECURE ACT 2.0
The SECURE Act 2.0 was signed into law on December 29, 2022. The Act builds on the SECURE Act 
of 2019. The three goals of the Act are to increase individual retirement savings, simplify and clarify the 
retirement plan rules, and lower the employer cost of setting up a retirement plan.
Key provisions of the Act that impact 2023 and beyond include the following:
• Increases the age for required minimum distributions for retirement plans from 72 to 73. 
Individuals who had not reached the age of 72 prior to January 1, 2023 are not required 
to take RMDs until April 1, 2025.
• Reduces the penalty for failure to take required minimum distributions from 50% to 25%. 
Further, if a failure to take a required minimum distribution from an IRA is corrected in a 
timely manner (within 2 years) the penalty is further reduced from 25% to 10%.

CHAPTER 1: FILING INFORMATION
Chapter Objective
After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• Recognize the length of the automatic extension provided by filing Form 4868.
I.   IMPORTANT REMINDERS 
Who must file. Generally, the amount of income you can receive before you must file a return has been 
increased. See Table 1-1 for the specific amounts. 
Installment agreement. If you cannot pay the full amount due with your return, you may ask to make 
monthly installment payments.
Automatic  6-month  extension.  Form 4868, Application  for  Automatic  Extension  of  Time  to  File  U.S.  
Individual Income Tax Return, provides for an automatic 6-month extension. When you file Form 4868, 
you will get an automatic extension to file for 6 months.

* If you were born on January 1, 1960, you are considered to be age 65 at the end of 2024.
** Gross income means all income you received in the form of money, goods, property, and services that is not exempt from tax, 
including any income from sources outside the United States (even if you may exclude part or all of it). Do not include social 
security benefits unless (a) you are married filing a separate return and you lived with your spouse at any time during 2024, or 
(b) one-half of your social security benefits plus your other gross income is more than $25,000 ($32,000 if married filing jointly). 
If (a) or (b) applies, see the Instructions for Form 1040 to figure the taxable part of social security benefits you must include 
in  gross  income.  Gross  income  includes  gains,  but  not  losses,  reported  on  Form  8949  or  Schedule  D.  Gross  income  from  a  
business means, for example, the amount on Schedule C, line 7, or Schedule F, line 9. But, in figuring gross income, do not 
reduce your income by any losses, including any loss on Schedule C, line 7, or Schedule F, line 9.
*** If you did not live with your spouse at the end of 2024 (or on the date your spouse died) and your gross income was at least 
$5, you must file a return regardless of your age.
CERTAIN CHILDREN UNDER AGE 19 OR FULL-TIME STUDENTS
If  a  child’s  only  income  is  interest  and  dividends  (including  capital  gain  distributions  and  Alaska 
Permanent Fund dividends), the child was under age 19 at the end of 2024 or was a full-time student 
under age 24 at the end of 2024, and certain other conditions are met, a parent can elect to include the 
child’s income on the parent’s return. If this election is made, the child does not have to file a return. See 
Parent’s Election To Report Child’s Interest and Dividends in chapter 30.

 16  •  Chapter 2: Filing Status
CHAPTER 2: FILING STATUS
Chapter Objective
After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• Recognize the various filing statuses and who is eligible to use them.
I.   INTRODUCTION 
This chapter helps you determine which filing status to use. There are five filing statuses:
• Single,
• Married Filing Jointly,
• Married Filing Separately,
• Head of Household, and
• Qualifying Surviving Spouse.
Tip
 
If more than one filing status applies to you, choose the one that will give you the lowest 
tax. 
You must determine your filing status before you can determine your filing requirements (chapter 1), your 
standard deduction (chapter 21), and your tax (chapter 29). You also use your filing status in determining 
whether you are eligible to claim certain deductions and credits. 
II. MARITAL STATUS 
In general, your filing status depends on whether you are considered unmarried or married. 
Unmarried  persons.  You are considered unmarried for the whole year if, on the last day of your tax 
year, you are either unmarried or legally separated from your spouse under a divorce or a separate 
maintenance decree. State law governs whether you are married or legally separated under a divorce or 
separate maintenance decree. 
Divorced  persons.  If  you  are  divorced  under  a  final  decree  by  the  last  day  of  the  year,  you  are 
considered unmarried for the whole year. 

 17  •  Chapter 2: Filing Status
Divorce and remarriage. If you obtain a divorce in one year for the sole purpose of filing tax returns as 
unmarried individuals, and at the time of divorce you intended to and do, in fact, remarry each other in 
the next tax year, you and your spouse must file as married individuals in both years. 
Annulled  marriages. If you obtain a court decree of annulment, which holds that no valid marriage 
ever existed, you are considered unmarried even if you filed joint returns for earlier years. You must 
file amended returns (Form 1040-X, Amended  U.S.  Individual  Income  Tax  Return)  claiming  single  or  
head of household status for all tax years affected by the annulment that are not closed by the statute 
of limitations for filing a tax return. Generally, for a credit or refund, you must file Form 1040-X within 3 
years (including extensions) after the date you filed your original return or within 2 years after the date 
you paid the tax, whichever is later. If you filed your original return early (for example, March 1), your 
return is considered filed on the due date (generally April 15). However, if you had an extension to file 
(for example, until October 15) but you filed earlier and we received it on July 1, your return is considered 
filed on July 1. 
Head  of  household  or  qualifying  surviving  spouse. If you are considered unmarried, you may be 
able to file as a head of household or as a qualifying surviving spouse. See Head  of  Household  and  
Qualifying Surviving Spouse to see if you qualify. 
Married persons. If you are considered married for the whole year, you and your spouse can file a joint 
return, or you can file separate returns. 
Considered married. You are considered married for the whole year, if on the last day of your tax year, 
you and your spouse meet any one of the following tests.
1. You are married and living together.
2. You are living together in a common law marriage that is recognized in the state where 
you now live or in the state where the common law marriage began. 
3. You are married and living apart, but not legally separated under a decree of divorce or 
separate maintenance.
4. You are separated under an interlocutory (not final) decree of divorce. 
Spouse died during the year. If your spouse died during the year, you are considered married for the 
whole year for filing status purposes. If you did not remarry before the end of the tax year, you can file 
a joint return for yourself and your deceased spouse. For the next 2 years, you may be entitled to the 
special benefits described later under Qualifying Surviving Spouse. If you remarried before the end of 
the tax year, you can file a joint return with your new spouse. Your deceased spouse’s filing status is 
married filing separately for that year. 
Married persons living apart. If you live apart from your spouse and meet certain tests, you may be 
able to file as head of household even though you are not divorced or legally separated. If you qualify to 
file as head of household instead of as married filing separately, your standard deduction will be higher. 
Also, your tax may be lower, and you may be able to claim the earned  income  credit.  See  Head  of  
Household, later.

 18  •  Chapter 2: Filing Status
III. SINGLE 
Your filing status is single if you are considered unmarried and you do not qualify for another filing status. 
To determine your marital status on the last day of the year, see Marital Status, earlier. 
Your filing status may be single if your spouse died before January 1, 2024, and did not remarry in 
2024. However, you might be able to use another filing status that will give you a lower tax. See Head of 
Household and Qualifying Surviving Spouse to see if you qualify. 
How to file. On Form 1040 or 1040-SR, check the “Single” box at the top of the form. 
I V.  MARRIED FILING JOINTLY 
You can choose married filing jointly as your filing status if you are considered married and both you and 
your spouse agree to file a joint return. On a joint return, you and your spouse report your combined 
income and deduct your combined allowable expenses. You can file a joint return even if one of you had 
no income or deductions. 
If you and your spouse decide to file a joint return, your tax may be lower than your combined tax for the 
other filing statuses. Also, your standard deduction (if you do not itemize deductions) may be higher, and 
you may qualify for tax benefits that do not apply to other filing statuses. 
How to file. On Form 1040 or 1040-SR, check the “Married filing jointly” box at the top of the form.
Spouse died during the year. If your spouse died during the year, you are considered married for the 
whole year and can choose married filing jointly as your filing status. See Spouse died during the year, 
earlier, for more information.
If your spouse died in 2025 before filing a 2024 return, you can choose married filing jointly as your filing 
status on your 2024 return.
Divorced persons. If you are divorced under a final decree by the last day of the year, you are considered 
unmarried for the whole year and you cannot choose married filing jointly as your filing status. 
FILING A JOINT RETURN 
Both you and your spouse must include all of your income, exemptions, and deductions on your joint 
return. 
Joint responsibility. Both of you may be held responsible, jointly and individually, for the tax and any 
interest or penalty due on your joint return. This means that if one spouse does not pay the tax due, the 
other may have to. Or, if one spouse does not report the correct tax, both spouses may be responsible 
for any additional taxes assessed by the IRS. One spouse may be held responsible for all the tax due 
even if all the income was earned by the other spouse.
You may want to file separately if:

 19  •  Chapter 2: Filing Status
• You believe your spouse is not reporting all of his or her income, or
• You do not want to be responsible for any taxes due if your spouse does not have enough 
tax withheld or does not pay enough estimated tax. 
Divorced  taxpayer.  You  may  be  held  jointly  and  individually  responsible  for  any  tax,  interest,  and 
penalties due on a joint return filed before your divorce. This responsibility may apply even if your divorce 
decree states that your former spouse will be responsible for any amounts due on previously filed joint 
returns. 
Relief from joint liability. In some cases, one spouse may be relieved of joint liability for tax, interest, 
and penalties on a joint return for items of the other spouse that were incorrectly reported on the joint 
return. You can ask for relief no matter how small the liability. There are three types of relief available.  
1. Innocent spouse relief. 
2. Separation of liability, which is available only to joint filers who are divorced, widowed, 
legally separated, or have not lived together for the 12 months ending the date election of 
this relief is filed. 
3. Equitable relief.
You must file Form 8857, Request for Innocent Spouse Relief, to request any of these kinds of relief. 
Signing a joint return. For a return to be considered a joint return, both spouses must generally sign the 
return. If your spouse died before signing the return, the executor or administrator must sign the return 
for your spouse. If neither you nor anyone else has yet been appointed as executor or administrator, you 
can sign the return for your spouse and enter “filing as surviving spouse” in the area where you sign the 
return. 
Spouse away from home. If your spouse is away from home, you should prepare the return, sign it, 
and send it to your spouse to sign so that it can be filed on time. 
Signing as guardian of spouse. If you are the guardian of your spouse who is mentally incompetent, 
you can sign the return for your spouse as guardian. 
Spouse  in  combat  zone. If your spouse is unable to sign the return because he or she is serving in 
a combat zone (such as the Persian Gulf Area, Serbia, Montenegro, Albania, or Afghanistan), and you 
do not have a power of attorney or other statement, you can sign for your spouse. Attach a signed 
statement to your return that explains that your spouse is serving in a combat zone. 
Nonresident  alien  or  dual-status  alien. A joint return generally cannot be filed if either spouse is a 
nonresident alien at any time during the tax year. However, if one spouse was a nonresident  alien  or  
dual-status alien who was married to a U.S. citizen or resident at the end of the year, the spouses can 
choose to file a joint return. If you do file a joint return, you and your spouse are both treated as U.S. 
residents for the entire tax year. 

 20  •  Chapter 2: Filing Status
V.   MARRIED FILING SEPARATELY 
You can choose married filing separately as your filing status if you are married. This filing status may 
benefit you if you want to be responsible only for your own tax or if it results in less tax than filing a joint 
return. If you and your spouse do not agree to file a joint return, you must use this filing status, unless 
you qualify for head of household status.
If you live apart from your spouse and meet certain tests, you may be considered unmarried and may be 
able to file as head of household. This can apply to you even if you are not divorced or legally separated. 
If you qualify to file as head of household, instead of as married filing separately, your tax may be lower, 
you may be able to claim the earned income credit and certain other credits, and your standard deduction 
will be higher. The head of household filing status allows you to choose the standard deduction even if 
your spouse chooses to itemize deductions. See Head of Household, later, for more information.
Tip
You will generally pay more combined tax on separate returns than you would on a joint 
return primarily because the tax rate is higher for married persons filing separately. 
However, unless you are required to file separately, you should figure your tax both 
ways (on a joint return and on separate returns). This way you can make sure you are 
using the filing status that results in the lowest combined tax.
VI. HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD  
You may be able to file as head of household if you meet all of the following requirements.
1. You  are  unmarried  or  “considered  unmarried”  on  the  last  day  of  the  year.  You  are  
“considered unmarried” on the last day of the year if you meet the following requirements:
• You file a separate return.
• You paid more than half the cost of keeping up your home for the tax year.
• Your  spouse  did  not  live  in  your  home  during  the  last  6  months  of  the  tax  
year.  Your  spouse  is  considered  to  live  in  your  home  even  if  he  or  she  is  
temporarily absent due to special circumstances.
• Your home was the main home of your child, stepchild, or foster child for 
more than half the year.
• You must be able to claim the child as a dependent. However, you meet 
this  test  if  you  cannot  claim  the  child  as  a  dependent  only  because  the 
noncustodial  parent  can  claim  the  child.  The  general  rules  for  claiming  the  
child as a dependent are explained in chapter 3.
2. You paid more than half the cost of keeping up a home for the year.

 21  •  Chapter 2: Filing Status
3. A  qualifying  person  lived  with  you  in  the  home  for  more  than  half  the  year  (except  for  
temporary absences, such as school). However, if the qualifying person is your dependent 
parent, he or she does not have to live with you. 
Tip
If you qualify to file as head of household, your tax rate usually will be lower than the 
rates for single or married filing separately. You will also receive a higher standard 
deduction than if you file as single or married filing separately.
QUALIFYING PERSON 
A qualifying person can be either a qualifying child or qualifying relative.
Example - Child
Your unmarried son lived with you all year and was 18 years old at the end of the year. 
He did not provide more than half of his own support and does not meet the tests to 
be a qualifying child of anyone else. As a result, he is your qualifying child (see Table 
3-1, Overview of the Rules for a Dependent in chapter 3) and, because he is single, your 
qualifying person for you to claim head of household filing status.
Home of qualifying person. Generally, the qualifying person must live with you for more than half of the 
year. 
Special rule for parent. If your qualifying person is your father or mother, you may be eligible to file as 
head of household even if your father or mother does not live with you. However, you must be able to 
claim your father or mother as a dependent. Also, you must pay more than half the cost of keeping up a 
home that was the main home for the entire year for your father or mother.
If you pay more than half the cost of keeping your parent in a rest home or home for the elderly, that 
counts as paying more than half the cost of keeping up your parent’s main home. 
Temporary absences. You and your qualifying person are considered to live together even if one or both 
of you are temporarily absent from your home due to special circumstances such as illness, education, 
business, vacation, military service, or detention in a juvenile facility. It must be reasonable to assume 
that the absent person will return to the household after the temporary absence. You must continue to 
keep up the home during the absence. 
Death or birth. You may be eligible to file as head of household if the individual who qualifies you for this 
filing status is born or dies during the year. If the individual is your qualifying child, the child must have 
lived with you for more than half the part of the year he or she was alive. 

 22  •  Chapter 2: Filing Status
VII. QUALIFYING SURVIVING SPOUSE 
If  your  spouse  died  in  2024,  you  can  use  married  filing  jointly  as  your filing  status  for  2024  if  you 
otherwise qualify to use that status. The year of death is the last year for which you can file jointly with 
your deceased spouse. See Married Filing Jointly, earlier. 
You may be eligible to use qualifying surviving spouse as your filing status for 2 years following the year 
of death of your spouse. For example, if your spouse died in 2023, and you have not remarried, you may 
be able to use this filing status for 2024 and 2025. 
This filing status entitles you to use joint return tax rates and the highest standard deduction amount (if 
you do not itemize deductions). This status does not entitle you to file a joint return. 
How to file. On Form 1040 or 1040-SR, check the “Qualifying surviving spouse” box on the top of the 
form. 
Eligibility rules. You are eligible to file your 2024 return as a qualifying surviving spouse if you meet all 
of the following tests.
1. You were entitled to file a joint return with your spouse for the year your spouse died. It 
does not matter whether you actually filed a joint return. 
2. Your spouse died in 2022 or 2023 and you did not remarry before the end of 2024. 
3. You have a child or stepchild (not a foster child) whom you can claim as a dependent or 
could claim as a dependent except that, for 2024:
a) The child had gross income of $5,050 or more,
b) The child filed a joint return, or
c) You could be claimed as a dependent on someone else’s return.
If  the  child  is  not  claimed  as  your  dependent  in  the  Dependents section on Form 1040 
or 1040-SR, enter the child’s name in the entry space at the far right of the filing status 
checkboxes (next to Qualifying surviving spouse).
4. This child lived in your home all year, except for temporary absences.
5. You paid more than half the cost of keeping up a home for the year.
Example
John’s wife died in 2022. John has not remarried. During 2023 and 2024, he continued 
to keep up a home for himself and his child who lives with him and for whom he can 
claim as a dependent. For 2022, he was entitled to file a joint return for himself and 
his deceased wife. For 2023 and 2024, he can file as qualifying surviving spouse. After 
2024, he can file as head of household if he qualifies.

 23  •  Chapter 2: Filing Status
Death or birth. You may be eligible to file as a qualifying surviving spouse if the child who qualifies you 
for this filing status is born or dies during the year. You must have provided more than half of the cost of 
keeping up a home that was the child’s main home during the entire part of the year he or she was alive.
Caution!
 
As mentioned earlier, this filing status is only available for 2 years following the year of 
death of your spouse.

CHAPTER 2: SOLUTIONS AND SUGGESTED RESPONSES
Below are the solutions and suggested responses for the questions on the previous page(s). If you 
choose an incorrect answer, you should review the pages as indicated for each question to ensure 
comprehension of the material.
1.A. Incorrect. Being the guardian of your spouse is a valid situation where one spouse can 
sign a joint tax return for the other spouse.
B. Incorrect. If your spouse is serving in a combat zone and you do not have a power of 
attorney or other statement, you can sign the joint tax return.
C. CORRECT. This is not a recognized exception, as a nonresident alien generally cannot 
sign a joint tax return.
D. Incorrect. If your spouse died before signing the return, the executor or administrator 
must sign the return for your spouse. If neither you nor anyone else has yet been 
appointed as executor or administrator, you can sign the return for your spouse and 
enter “filing as surviving spouse” in the area where you sign the return.
(See page 20 of the course material.) 
2.A. CORRECT. This is because the tax rate is higher for married persons filing separately.
B. Incorrect. However, unless you are required to file separately, you should figure your 
tax both ways, and make sure you are using the filing status that results in the lowest 
combined tax.
(See page 21 of the course material.)
3.A. CORRECT. Along with other qualifications, you may be able to file as head of household 
if a qualifying person has lived with you for more than half of the year. If the person is 
your dependent, however, he or she does not have to live with you.
B. Incorrect. Generally, the qualifying person only has to live with you for more than half of 
the year, but not necessarily for the entire year. Be aware there are other requirements 
that must also be met in order to file as head of household.
C. Incorrect. In order to file as head of household, a person must live with you for more 
than half of the year. Be aware there are other requirements that must also be met in 
order to file as head of household.
D. Incorrect. Generally, the qualifying person only has to live with you for more than half 
of the year, not for two consecutive years. Be aware there are other requirements that 
must also be met in order to file as head of household.
(See pages 21 to 22 of the course material.)

CHAPTER 3: SOLUTIONS AND SUGGESTED RESPONSES
Below  is  the  solution  and  suggested  responses  for  the  question  on  the  previous  page.  If  you 
choose an incorrect answer, you should review the page(s) as indicated for the question to ensure 
comprehension of the material.
1.A. Incorrect. Under the dependent taxpayer test, the taxpayer cannot claim anyone else 
as a dependent if he or she can be claimed as a dependent by another person. Even 
if you have a qualifying child or qualifying relative, you cannot claim that person as a 
dependent.
B. Incorrect. Under the joint return test, you generally cannot claim a married person as a 
dependent if he or she files a joint return. Therefore, even if you have a qualifying child, 
if that child files a joint return (other than to claim a refund), you cannot claim him or her 
as a dependent. 
C. Incorrect. Under the citizen or resident test, you cannot claim a person as a dependent 
unless that person is a U.S. citizen, U.S. resident alien, U.S. national, or a resident of 
Canada or Mexico. However, there is an exception for adopted children.
D. CORRECT. The age test is specific to a qualifying child, but not a qualifying relative. In 
order to be a qualifying child, the child must be under age 19 at the end of the year and 
younger than you (or your spouse if filing jointly), a full-time student under age 24 at the 
end of the year and younger than you (or your spouse if filing jointly), or permanently 
and totally disabled at any time during the year, regardless of age.

CHAPTER 4: ESTIMATED TAX
Chapter Objective
After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• Identify the purpose of estimated taxes.
I.   IMPORTANT 
Estimated  tax  safe  harbor  for  higher  income  taxpayers. If your 2024 adjusted gross income was 
more than $150,000 ($75,000 if you are married filing a separate return), you will have to deposit the 
smaller of 90% of your expected tax for 2025 or 110% of the tax shown on your 2024 return to avoid an 
estimated tax penalty.
II. ESTIMATED TAX 
Estimated tax is the method used to pay tax on income that is not subject to withholding. This includes 
income from self-employment, interest, dividends, certain alimony, rent, gains from the sale of assets, 
prizes, and awards. You also may have to pay estimated tax if the amount of income tax being withheld 
from your salary, pension, or other income is not enough. 
Estimated tax is used to pay both income tax and self-employment tax, as well as other taxes and 
amounts  reported  on  your  tax  return.  If  you  do  not  pay  enough  tax,  either  through  withholding  or 
estimated tax, or a combination of both, you may have to pay a penalty. If you do not pay enough by 
the due date of each payment period (see When To Pay Estimated Tax, later), you may have to pay a 
penalty even if you are due a refund when you file your tax return. 
WHO MUST PAY ESTIMATED TAX PAYMENTS?
If you owe additional tax for 2024, you may have to pay estimated tax for 2025. 
General rule. In most cases, you must pay estimated tax for 2025 if both of the following apply. 
1. You expect to owe at least $1,000 in tax for 2025 after subtracting your withholding and 
refundable credits. 
2. You expect your withholding plus your refundable credits to be less than the smaller of: 
• 90% of the tax to be shown on your 2025 tax return, or 
• 100% of the tax shown on your 2024 tax return. Your 2024 tax return must 
cover all 12 months. 

 31  •  Chapter 4: Estimated Tax
Special rules for farmers, fishermen, and higher income taxpayers. There  are  exceptions  to  the  
general rule for farmers, fishermen, and certain higher income taxpayers. See Figure 4-A.
FIGURE 4-A. DO YOU HAVE TO PAY ESTIMATED TAX?
WHEN TO PAY ESTIMATED TAX 
For estimated tax purposes, the year is divided into four payment periods. Each period has a specific 
payment due date. If you do not pay enough tax by the due date of each of the payment periods, you 
may be charged a penalty even if you are due a refund when you file your income tax return. The 
following chart gives the payment periods and due dates for estimated tax payments.
For the period:Due Date:
Jan. 1 through Mar. 31Apr. 15
Apr. 1 through May 31Jun. 15
Jun. 1 through Aug. 31Sept. 15
Saturday,  Sunday,  holiday  rule. If the due date for an estimated tax payment falls on a Saturday, 
Sunday, or legal holiday, the payment will be on time if you make it on the next day that is not a Saturday, 
Sunday, or legal holiday.

Below are the solutions and suggested responses for the questions on the previous page(s). If you 
choose an incorrect answer, you should review the pages as indicated for each question to ensure 
comprehension of the material.
1.A. CORRECT. For 2024, if your adjusted gross income was more than $150,000 ($75,000

 35  •  Chapter 5: Wages, Salaries, and Other Earnings
CHAPTER 5: WAGES, SALARIES, 
AND OTHER EARNINGS
Chapter Objective
After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• Recall what types of compensation are included as income for tax purposes.
I.   WHAT’S NEW
For 2024, the tax rate on the employee portion of social security is 6.2% on wages up to $168,600. 
Social security tax withholdings should not exceed $10,453.20. Medicare tax of 1.45% is withheld from 
all wages regardless of amount.
Self-employment tax of 15.3% applies to earnings of up to $168,600 after the earnings are reduced 
by 7.65%. The 15.3% rate equals 12.4% for social security (6.2% employee share and 6.2% employer 
share) plus 2.9% for Medicare. If net earnings exceed $168,600, the 2.9% Medicare rate applies to the 
entire amount. For 2025, the wage base will rise to $174,900.
Net self-employment earnings will be subject to the 0.9% Additional Medicare  Tax  if  earnings  exceed  
$200,000 if single, head of household, or qualifying widow(er), $250,000 if married filing jointly, and 
$125,000 if married filing separately. 
II. INTRODUCTION 
This chapter discusses compensation received for services as an employee, such as wages, salaries, 
and fringe benefits. The following topics are included: 
• Bonuses and awards, 
• Special rules for certain employees, and 
• Sickness and injury benefits. 
The chapter explains what income is included in the employee’s gross income and what is not included. 
III. EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION 
This section discusses various types of employee compensation followed by a detailed explanation of 
fringe benefits. 

 36  •  Chapter 5: Wages, Salaries, and Other Earnings
MISCELLANEOUS COMPENSATION 
Bonuses and awards. If you receive a bonus or award (cash, goods, services) from your employer, you 
must include its value in your income. However, if your employer merely promises to pay you a bonus or 
award at some future time, it is not taxable until you receive it or it is made available to you. 
Sick  pay. Pay you receive from your employer while you are sick or injured is part of your salary or 
wages. In addition, you must include in your income sick pay benefits received from any of the following 
payers.  
1. A welfare fund. 
2. A state sickness or disability fund. 
3. An association of employers or employees. 
4. An insurance company, if your employer paid for the plan. 
However, if you paid the premiums on an accident or health insurance policy yourself, the benefits you 
receive under the policy are not taxable. 
FRINGE BENEFITS 
Fringe benefits received in connection with the performance of your services are included in your income 
as compensation unless you pay fair market value for them or they are specifically excluded by law. 
Refraining from the performance of services (for example, under a covenant not to compete) is treated 
as the performance of services for purposes of these rules. 
Accident or Health Plan
In most cases, the value of accident or health plan coverage provided to you by your employer is not 
included in your income. Benefits you receive from the plan may be taxable, as explained later under 
Sickness and Injury Benefits.
Long-term  care  coverage.  Contributions  by  your  employer  to  provide  coverage  for  long-term  care 
services are generally not included in income. However, contributions made through a flexible spending 
or similar arrangement offered by your employer must be included in your income. This amount will be 
reported as wages in box 1 of your Form W-2. 
Archer  MSA  contributions. Contributions by your employer to your Archer MSA are not included in 
your income. Their total will be reported in box 12 of Form W-2 with code R. You must report this amount 
on Form 8853, Archer MSAs and Long-Term Care Insurance Contracts. File the form with your return. 
De Minimis (Minimal) Benefits 
If your employer provides you with a product or service and the cost of it is so small that it would be 
unreasonable for the employer to account for it, you generally do not include the value in your income. In 
most cases, the value of discounts at company cafeterias, cab fares home when working overtime, and 
company picnics are not included in your income. 

 37  •  Chapter 5: Wages, Salaries, and Other Earnings
Holiday gifts. If your employer gives you a turkey, ham, or other item of nominal value at Christmas or 
other holidays, do not include the value of the gift in your income. However, if your employer gives you 
cash or cash equivalent, you must include it in your income. 
Educational Assistance 
You can exclude from your income up to $5,250 of qualified employer-provided educational assistance.
Group-Term Life Insurance  
In most cases, the cost of up to $50,000 of group-term life insurance coverage provided to you by your 
employer (or former employer) is not included in your income. However, you must include in income the 
cost of employer-provided insurance that is more than the cost of $50,000 of coverage reduced by any 
amount you pay toward the purchase of the insurance. 
Transportation
If your employer provides you with a qualified transportation fringe benefit, it can be excluded from your 
income, up to certain limits. A qualified transportation fringe benefit is:
• Transportation in a commuter highway vehicle (such as a van) between your home and 
work place,
• A transit pass, or
• Qualified parking.
Cash  reimbursement  by  your  employer  for  these  expenses  under  a  bona  fide  reimbursement 
arrangement is also excludable. However, cash reimbursement for a transit pass is excludable only if 
a voucher or similar item that can be exchanged only for a transit pass is not readily available for direct 
distribution to you.
Exclusion  limit.  The  exclusion  for  commuter  highway  vehicle  transportation  and  transit  pass  fringe 
benefits cannot be more than $315 a month. 
The exclusion for the qualified parking fringe benefit cannot be more than $315 per month. 
If the benefits have a value that is more than these limits, the excess must be included in your income. 
Commuter highway vehicle. This is a highway vehicle that seats at least six adults (not including the 
driver). At least 80% of the vehicle’s mileage must reasonably be expected to be:
• For transporting employees between their homes and work place, and
• On  trips  during  which  employees  occupy  at  least  half  of  the  vehicle’s  adult  seating  
capacity (not including the driver).

 38  •  Chapter 5: Wages, Salaries, and Other Earnings
Transit pass. This is any pass, token, farecard, voucher, or similar item entitling a person to ride mass 
transit (whether public or private) free or at a reduced rate or to ride in a commuter highway vehicle 
operated by a person in the business of transporting persons for compensation.
Qualifying parking. This is parking provided to an employee at or near the employer’s place of business. 
It also includes parking provided on or near a location from which the employee commutes to work by 
mass transit, in a commuter highway vehicle, or by carpool. It does not include parking at or near the 
employee’s home.
I V.  SPECIAL RULES FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEES 
FOREIGN EMPLOYER 
Special rules apply if you work for a foreign employer. 
U.S.  citizen.  If you are a U.S. citizen who works in the United States for a foreign government, an 
international organization, a foreign embassy, or any foreign employer, you must include your salary in 
your income. 
Social security and Medicare taxes. You are exempt from social security and Medicare taxes if you 
are employed in the United States by an international organization or a foreign government. However, 
you must pay self-employment tax on your earnings from services performed in the United States, even 
though you are not self-employed. This rule also applies if you are an employee of a qualifying wholly-
owned instrumentality of a foreign government. 
Employees  of  international  organizations  or  foreign  governments.  Your compensation for official 
services  to  an  international  organization  is  exempt  from  federal  income  tax  if  you  are  not  a  citizen  of  
the United States or you are a citizen of the Philippines (whether or not you are a citizen of the United 
States).
Your compensation for official services to a foreign government is exempt from federal income tax if all 
of the following are true:
• You are not a citizen of the United States or you are a citizen of the Philippines (whether 
or not you are a citizen of the United States).
• Your work is like the work done by employees of the United States in foreign countries.
• The foreign government gives an equal exemption to employees of the United States in 
its country.
Waiver  of  alien  status.  If  you  are  an  alien  who  works  for  a  foreign  government  or  international 
organization and you file a waiver under section 247(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to keep 
your immigrant status, different rules may apply. 

 39  •  Chapter 5: Wages, Salaries, and Other Earnings
MILITARY 
Payments  you  receive  as  a  member  of  a  military  service  generally  are  taxed  as  wages  except  for 
retirement pay, which is taxed as a pension. Allowances generally are not taxed.
Military retirement pay. If your retirement pay is based on age or length of service, it is taxable and must 
be included in your income as a pension on lines 5a and 5b of Form 1040 or 1040-SR. Do not include in 
your income the amount of any reduction in retirement or retainer pay to provide a survivor annuity for 
your spouse or children under the Retired Serviceman’s Family Protection Plan or the Survivor Benefit 
Plan. 
Veterans’ benefits. Do not include in your income any veterans’ benefits paid under any law, regulation, 
or  administrative  practice  administered  by  the  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA).  The  following 
amounts paid to veterans or their families are not taxable.
• Education, training, and subsistence allowances. 
• Disability compensation and pension payments for disabilities paid either to veterans or 
their families.
• Grants for homes designed for wheelchair living. 
• Grants for motor vehicles for veterans who lost their sight or the use of their limbs.
• Veterans’ insurance proceeds and dividends paid either to veterans or their beneficiaries, 
including the proceeds of a veteran’s endowment policy paid before death. 
• Interest on insurance dividends you leave on deposit with the VA.
• Benefits under a dependent-care assistance program.
• The death gratuity paid to a survivor of a member of the Armed Forces who dies after 
September 10, 2001.
• Payments made under the compensated work therapy program.
• Any bonus payment by a state or political subdivision because of service in a combat 
zone. 
VOLUNTEERS
Peace Corps. Living allowances you receive as a Peace Corps volunteer or volunteer leader for housing, 
utilities, household supplies, food, and clothing are exempt from tax. 
Taxable allowances. The following allowances must be included in your income and reported as wages. 
• Allowances  paid  to  your  spouse  and  minor  children  while  you  are  a  volunteer  leader  
training in the United States. 

 40  •  Chapter 5: Wages, Salaries, and Other Earnings
• Living allowances designated by the Director of the Peace Corps as basic compensation. 
These are allowances for personal items such as domestic help, laundry and clothing 
maintenance,  entertainment  and  recreation,  transportation,  and  other  miscellaneous 
expenses. 
• Leave allowances. 
• Readjustment allowances or termination payments. These are considered received by 
you when credited to your account. 
Example
Gary Carpenter, a Peace Corps volunteer, gets $175 a month as a readjustment allowance 
during his period of service, to be paid to him in a lump sum at the end of his tour of 
duty. Although the allowance is not available to him until the end of his service, Gary 
must include it in his income on a monthly basis as it is credited to his account. 
Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA). If you are a VISTA volunteer, you must include meal and 
lodging allowances paid to you in your income as wages. 
National  Senior  Services  Corps  programs.  Do  not  include  in  your  income  amounts  you  receive  for  
supportive services or reimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses from the following programs.
• Retired Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP). 
• Foster Grandparent Program. 
• Senior Companion Program. 
Service  Corps  of  Retired  Executives  (SCORE).  If  you  receive  amounts  for  supportive  services  or  
reimbursements  for  out-of-pocket  expenses  from  SCORE,  do  not  include  these  amounts  in  gross 
income. 
V.   SICKNESS AND INJURY BENEFITS
In  most  cases,  you  must  report  as  income  any  amount  you  receive  for  personal  injury  or  sickness 
through an accident or health plan that is paid for by your employer. If both you and your employer pay 
for the plan, only the amount you receive that is due to your employer’s payments is reported as income. 
However, certain payments may not be taxable to you.  

 41  •  Chapter 5: Wages, Salaries, and Other Earnings
Tip
 
Do not report as income any amounts paid to reimburse you for medical expenses you 
incurred after the plan was established.
Cafeteria plans. In most cases, if you are covered by an accident or health insurance plan through a 
cafeteria plan, and the amount of the insurance premiums was not included in your income, you are not 
considered to have paid the premiums and you must include any benefits you receive in your income. If 
the amount of the premiums was included in your income, you are considered to have paid the premiums, 
and any benefits you receive are not taxable. 
DISABILITY PENSIONS
If you retired on disability, you must include in income any disability pension you receive under a plan 
that is paid for by your employer. You must report your taxable disability payments as wages on line 1h 
of Form 1040 or 1040-SR until you reach minimum retirement age. Minimum retirement age generally is 
the age at which you can first receive a pension or annuity if you are not disabled. There is a tax credit 
for people who are permanently and totally disabled when they retired. For information on this credit and 
the definition of permanent and total disability, see chapter 32.
Beginning on the day after you reach minimum retirement age, payments you receive are taxable as a 
pension or annuity. Report the payments on lines 5a and 5b of Form 1040 or 1040-SR.
Retirement and profit-sharing plans. If you receive payments from a retirement or profit-sharing plan 
that does not provide for disability retirement, do not treat the payments as a disability pension. The 
payments must be reported as a pension or annuity. For more information on pensions, see chapter 10. 
Accrued  leave  payment. If you retire on disability, any lump-sum payment you receive for accrued 
annual leave is a salary payment. The payment is not a disability payment. Include it in your income in 
the tax year you receive it. 
Military and Government Disability Pensions  
Certain military and government disability pensions are not taxable. 
Service-connected  disability.  You may be able to exclude from income amounts you receive as a 
pension, annuity, or similar allowance for personal injury or sickness resulting from active service in one 
of the following government services. 
• The armed forces of any country. 
• The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 

 42  •  Chapter 5: Wages, Salaries, and Other Earnings
• The Public Health Service. 
• The Foreign Service. 
Pension based on years of service. If you receive a disability pension based on years of service, you 
generally must include it in your income. However, if the pension qualifies for the exclusion for a service-
connected disability, do not include in income the part of your pension that you would have received if 
the pension had been based on a percentage of disability. You must include the rest of your pension in 
your income. 
Terrorist attack or military action. Do not include in your income disability payments you receive for 
injuries resulting directly from a terrorist attack directed against the United States (or its allies), whether 
outside or within the United States or from military action.
WORKERS’ COMPENSATION 
Amounts you receive as workers’ compensation for an occupational sickness or injury are fully exempt 
from tax if they are paid under a workers’ compensation act or a statute in the nature of a workers’ 
compensation act. The exemption also applies to your survivors. The exemption, however, does not 
apply to retirement plan benefits you receive based on your age, length of service, or prior contributions 
to the plan, even if you retired because of an occupational sickness or injury. 
OTHER SICKNESS AND INJURY BENEFITS
Railroad sick pay. Payments you receive as sick pay under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act 
are taxable and you must include them in your income. However, do not include them in your income if 
they are for an on-the-job injury. 
Federal Employees’ Compensation Act (FECA). Payments received under this Act for personal injury 
or sickness, including payments to beneficiaries in case of death, are not taxable. However, you are 
taxed on amounts you receive under this Act as continuation of pay for up to 45 days while a claim is 
being decided. Report this income as wages. Also, pay for sick leave while a claim is being processed is 
taxable and must be included in your income as wages. 
Caution!
If  part  of  the  payments  you  receive  under  FECA  reduces  your social  security  or 
equivalent railroad retirement benefits received, that part is considered social security 
(or equivalent railroad retirement) benefits and may be taxable.
Other compensation. Many other amounts you receive as compensation for sickness or injury are not 
taxable. These include the following amounts. 
• Compensatory damages you receive for physical injury or physical sickness, whether 
paid in a lump sum or in periodic payments. 

 43  •  Chapter 5: Wages, Salaries, and Other Earnings
• Benefits you receive under an accident or health insurance policy on which either you 
paid the premiums or your employer paid the premiums but you had to include them in 
your income.
• Disability benefits you receive for loss of income or earning capacity as a result of injuries 
under a no-fault car insurance policy.
• Compensation you receive for permanent loss or loss of use of a part or function of your 
body, or for your permanent disfigurement. This compensation must be based only on the 
injury and not on the period of your absence from work. These benefits are not taxable 
even if your employer pays for the accident and health plan that provides these benefits.
Reimbursement for medical care. A reimbursement for medical care is generally not taxable. However, 
it may reduce your medical expense deduction.

CHAPTER 6: TIP INCOME
Chapter Objective
After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• Recognize what tips should be included in income for tax purposes.
I.   REPORTING TIP INCOME 
This chapter is for employees who receive tips.
All tips you receive are income and are subject to federal income tax. You must include in gross income 
all tips you receive directly, charged tips paid to you by your employer, and your share of any tips you 
receive under a tip-splitting or tip-pooling arrangement.
The value of noncash tips, such as tickets, passes, or other items of value, is also income and subject 
to tax.
Reporting your tip income correctly is not difficult. You must do three things.  
1. Keep a daily tip record. 
2. Report tips to your employer.

 51  •  Chapter 7: Interest Income
CHAPTER 7: INTEREST INCOME
Chapter Objective
After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• Recall the proper tax treatment for various types of interest.
I.   IMPORTANT REMINDER  
Foreign-source income. If you are a U.S. citizen with interest income from sources outside the United 
States (foreign income), you must report that income on your tax return unless it is exempt by U.S. law. 
This  is  true  whether  you  reside  inside  or  outside  the  United  States  and  whether  or  not  you  receive  a  
Form 1099 from the foreign payer.
II. INTRODUCTION 
This chapter discusses: 
• Different types of interest income, and 
• What interest is taxable and what interest is nontaxable.  
III. TAXABLE INTEREST  
Taxable interest includes interest you receive from bank accounts, loans you make to others, and other 
sources. The following are some other sources of taxable interest.  
Dividends  that  are  actually  interest.  Certain  distributions  commonly  called dividends  are  actually  
interest. You must report as interest so-called “dividends” on deposits or on share accounts in: 
• Cooperative banks,  
• Credit unions,  
• Domestic building and loan associations,  
• Domestic savings and loan associations,  
• Federal savings and loan associations, and  
• Mutual savings banks.
The “dividends” will be shown as interest on Form 1099-INT.

 52  •  Chapter 7: Interest Income
Money market funds. Generally, amounts you receive from money market funds should be reported as 
dividends, not as interest.  
Certificates of deposit and other deferred interest accounts. If you open any of these accounts, 
interest may be paid at fixed intervals of 1 year or less during the term of the account. You generally 
must include this interest in your income when you actually receive it or are entitled to receive it without 
paying a substantial penalty. The same is true for accounts that mature in 1 year or less and pay interest 
in a single payment at maturity. If interest is deferred for more than 1 year, see Original Issue Discount 
(OID), later.  
Interest subject to penalty for early withdrawal. If you withdraw funds from a deferred interest account 
before maturity, you may have to pay a penalty. You must report the total amount of interest paid or 
credited to your account during the year, without subtracting the penalty.
Interest  on  insurance  dividends. Interest  on  insurance  dividends  left  on  deposit  with  an  insurance  
company that can be withdrawn annually is taxable to you in the year it is credited to your account. 
However, if you can withdraw it only on the anniversary date of the policy (or other specified date), the 
interest is taxable in the year that date occurs.
Prepaid  insurance  premiums. Any increase in the value of prepaid insurance premiums, advance 
premiums, or premium deposit funds is interest if it is applied  to the payment of premiums due on 
insurance policies or made available for you to withdraw.  
U.S. obligations. Interest on U.S. obligations, such as U.S. Treasury bills, notes, and bonds, issued by 
any agency or instrumentality of the United States is taxable for federal income tax purposes. 
Interest on tax refunds. Interest you receive on tax refunds is taxable income.  
Interest on condemnation award. If the condemning authority pays you interest to compensate you for 
a delay in paying an award, the interest is taxable.  
Installment  sale  payments.  If  a  contract  for  the  sale  or  exchange  of  property  provides  for  deferred  
payments, it also usually provides for interest payable with the deferred payments. Generally, that interest 
is taxable when you receive it. If little or no interest is provided for in a deferred payment contract, part of 
each payment may be treated as interest. 
Interest on annuity contract. Accumulated interest on an annuity contract you sell before its maturity 
date is taxable.  
Usurious  interest. Usurious interest is interest charged at an illegal rate. This is taxable as interest 
unless state law automatically changes it to a payment on the principal.  
Interest  income  on  frozen  deposits.  Exclude  from  your  gross  income  interest  on  frozen  deposits.  A  
deposit is frozen if, at the end of the year, you cannot withdraw any part of the deposit because:     
1. The financial institution is bankrupt or insolvent, or  

 53  •  Chapter 7: Interest Income
2. The state where the institution is located has placed limits on withdrawals because other 
financial institutions in the state are bankrupt or insolvent.    
The amount of interest you must exclude is the interest that was credited on the frozen deposits minus 
the sum of:
1. The net amount you withdrew from these deposits during the year, and
2. The amount you could have withdrawn as of the end of the year (not reduced by any 
penalty for premature withdrawals of a time deposit).   
The interest you exclude is treated as credited to your account in the following year. You must include it 
in income in the year you can withdraw it.
Example
$100 of interest was credited on your frozen deposit during the year. You withdrew 
$80 but could not withdraw any more as of the end of the year. You must include $80 
in your income for the year and exclude $20 from your income for the year. You must 
include the $20 in your income for the year you can withdraw it.  
Bonds traded flat. If you buy a bond when interest has been defaulted or when the interest has accrued 
but has not been paid, the transaction is described as trading a bond flat. The defaulted or unpaid 
interest is not income and is not taxable as interest if paid later. When you receive a payment of that 
interest, it is a return of capital that reduces the remaining cost basis of your bond. Interest that accrues 
after the date of purchase, however, is taxable interest income for the year it is received or accrued. See 
Bonds Sold Between Interest Dates, later, for more information.  
Below-market loans. A below-market loan is a loan on which no interest is charged or on which interest 
is charged at a rate below the applicable federal rate. 
U.S. SAVINGS BONDS
Accrual method taxpayers. If you use an accrual method of accounting, you must report interest on 
U.S. savings bonds each year as it accrues. You cannot postpone reporting interest until you receive it 
or the bonds mature.   
Cash method taxpayers. If you use the cash method of accounting, as most individual taxpayers do, 
you generally report the interest on U.S. savings bonds when you receive it.   
U.S. TREASURY BILLS, NOTES, AND BONDS
Treasury bills, notes, and bonds are direct debts (obligations) of the U.S. Government.
Taxation of interest. Interest income from Treasury bills, notes, and bonds is subject to federal income 
tax, but is exempt from all state and local income taxes. You should receive a Form 1099-INT showing 
the amount of interest (in box 3) that was paid to you for the year.

 54  •  Chapter 7: Interest Income
Treasury  bills. These bills generally have a 4-week, 13-week, 26-week, or 52-week maturity period. 
They are issued at a discount in the amount of $100 and multiples of $100. The difference between 
the discounted price you pay for the bills and the face value you receive at maturity is interest income. 
Generally, you report this interest income when the bill is paid at maturity. If you paid a premium for a 
bill (more than face value), you generally report the premium as a section 171 deduction when the bill is 
paid at maturity.
Treasury notes and bonds. Treasury notes have maturity periods of more than one year, ranging up to 
ten years. Maturity periods for Treasury bonds are longer than ten years. Both of these Treasury issues 
generally are issued in denominations of $100 to $1 million. Both notes and bonds generally pay interest 
every six months. Generally, you report this interest for the year paid. 
BONDS SOLD BETWEEN INTEREST DATES    
If you sell a bond between interest payment dates, part of the sales price represents interest accrued to 
the date of sale. You must report that part of the sales price as interest income for the year of sale. 
If you buy a bond between interest payment dates, part of the purchase price represents interest accrued 
before the date of purchase. When that interest is paid to you, treat it as a nontaxable return of your 
capital investment, rather than interest income. 
INSURANCE
Life insurance proceeds paid to you as beneficiary of the insured person are usually not taxable. But if 
you receive the proceeds in installments, you must usually report a part of each installment payment as 
interest income.
Annuity. If you buy an annuity with life insurance proceeds, the annuity payments you receive are taxed 
as pension and annuity income from a nonqualified plan, not as interest  income.  See  chapter  10  for  
information on pension and annuity income from nonqualified plans. 
ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT (OID)       
Original issue discount (OID) is a form of interest. You generally include OID in your income as it accrues 
over the term of the debt instrument, whether or not you receive any payments from the issuer. 
A debt instrument generally has OID when the instrument is issued for a price that is less than its stated 
redemption price at maturity. OID is the difference between the stated redemption price at maturity and 
the issue price. 
All debt instruments that pay no interest before maturity are presumed to be issued at a discount. Zero 
coupon bonds are one example of these instruments. 

 55  •  Chapter 7: Interest Income
The OID accrual rules generally do not apply to short-term obligations (those with a fixed maturity date 
of 1 year or less from date of issue).
Example 1
You bought a 10-year bond with a stated redemption price at maturity of $1,000, issued 
at $980 with OID of $20. One-fourth of 1% of $1,000 (stated redemption price) times 
10 (the number of full years from the date of original issue to maturity) equals $25. 
Because the $20 discount is less than $25, the OID is treated as zero. (If you hold the 
bond at maturity, you will recognize $20 ($1,000 - $980) of capital gain.)  
Example 2
The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the bond was issued at $950. The 
OID is $50. Because the $50 discount is more than the $25 figured in Example 1, you 
must include the OID in income as it accrues over the term of the bond.
Debt instrument bought after original issue. If you buy a debt instrument with de minimis OID at a 
premium, the discount is not includible in income. If you buy a debt instrument with de minimis OID at a 
discount, the discount is reported under the market discount rules.  
Certificates of deposit (CDs). If you buy a CD with a maturity of more than 1 year, you must include in 
income each year a part of the total interest due and report it in the same manner as other OID. 
This  also  applies  to  similar  deposit  arrangements  with  banks,  building  and  loan  associations,  etc., 
including: 
• Time deposits
• Bonus plans,  
• Savings certificates,  
• Deferred income certificates,  
• Bonus savings certificates, and  
• Growth savings certificates.  
Bearer  CDs.  CDs issued after 1982 generally must be in registered form. Bearer CDs are CDs that 
are not in registered form. They are not issued in the depositor’s name and are transferable from one 
individual to another. 
Banks must provide the IRS and the person redeeming a bearer CD with a Form 1099-INT.  

 56  •  Chapter 7: Interest Income
STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS
Interest on a bond used to finance government operations generally is not taxable if the bond is issued by 
a state, the District of Columbia, a possession of the United  States, or any of their political subdivisions.
Bonds issued after 1982 (including tribal economic development bonds issued after February 17, 2009) 
by an Indian tribal government are treated as issued by a state. Interest on these bonds is generally tax 
exempt if the bonds are part of an issue of which substantially all proceeds are to be used in the exercise 
of any essential government function.

CHAPTER 8: DIVIDENDS AND OTHER 
DISTRIBUTIONS
Chapter Objective
After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• Identify the proper treatment of various types of dividends.
I.   WHAT’S NEW
CAPITAL GAINS AND DIVIDENDS
Qualified dividends and long-term capital gains may escape tax entirely under the 0% rate, or be subject 
to capital gain rates of 15% or 20% depending on filing status, taxable income, and how much of the 
taxable income consists of qualified dividends and eligible long-term gains. The 20% capital gain rate 
taxable income thresholds for 2024 are either $583,750, $551,350, $518,900, or $291,850, depending 
on the filing status. The 0%, 15%, and 20% rates do not apply to long-term gains from collectibles, which 
are subject to a 28% rate, or the 25% rate for unrecaptured real estate depreciation. 
II. INTRODUCTION 
This chapter discusses the tax treatment of: 
• Ordinary dividends, 
• Capital gain distributions, 
• Nontaxable distributions, and 
• Other distributions you may receive from a corporation or a mutual fund. 
III. ORDINARY DIVIDENDS 
Ordinary (taxable) dividends are the most common type of distribution from a corporation or a mutual 
fund. They are paid out of the earnings and profits of a corporation and are ordinary income to you. 
This  means  they  are  not  capital  gains.  You  can  assume  that  any  dividend  you  receive  on  common  
or preferred stock is an ordinary dividend  unless  the  paying  corporation  tells  you  otherwise.  Ordinary 
dividends will be shown in box 1a of the Form 1099-DIV you receive. 

 60  •  Chapter 8: Dividends and Other Distributions
QUALIFIED DIVIDENDS
Qualified dividends are the ordinary dividends subject to the same 0%, 15%, or 20% maximum tax rate 
that applies to net capital gain. They should be shown in box 1b of Form 1099-DIV you receive.
The maximum rate of tax on qualified dividends is the following.
• The 0% rate applies to -
 ▫Single filers with income up to $47,025,
 ▫Married filers filing separately with income up to $47,025,
 ▫Head of household filers with income up to $63,000,
 ▫Joint filers with income up to $94,050,
 ▫Trusts and estates with income up to $3,150;
• The 15% rate applies to -
 ▫Single filers with income between $47,025 and $518,900,
 ▫Married filers filing separately with income between $47,025 and $291,850,
 ▫Head of household filers with income between $63,000 and $551,350,
 ▫Joint filers with income between $94,050 and $583,750,
 ▫Trusts and estates with income between $3,150 and $15,450; and
• The 20% rate applies to -
 ▫Single filers with income exceeding $518,900,
 ▫Married filers filing separately with income exceeding $291,850,
 ▫Head of household filers with income exceeding $551,350,
 ▫Joint filers with income exceeding $583,750, 
 ▫Trusts and estates with income exceeding $15,450.
To qualify for the maximum rate, all of the following requirements must be met.
• The dividends must have been paid by a U.S. corporation or a qualified foreign corporation. 
• The  dividends  are  not  of  the  type  listed  later  under  Dividends  that are not qualified 
dividends, later.
• You meet the holding period (discussed next).
Holding  period. You must have held the stock for more than 60 days during the 121-day period that 
begins 60 days before the ex-dividend date. The ex-dividend date is the first date following the declaration 
of a dividend on which the buyer of a stock will not receive the next dividend payment. Instead, the seller 
will get the dividend.

 61  •  Chapter 8: Dividends and Other Distributions
When counting the number of days you held the stock, include the day you disposed of the stock, but not 
the day you acquired it.
Exception for preferred stock. In the case of preferred stock, you must have held the stock more than 
90 days during the 181-day period that begins 90 days before the ex-dividend date if the dividends are 
attributable to periods totaling more than 366 days. If the preferred dividends are attributable to periods 
totaling less than 367 days, the holding period in the previous paragraph applies.
Dividends that are not qualified dividends. The following dividends are not qualified dividends. They 
are not qualified dividends even if they are shown in box 1b of Form 1099-DIV.
• Capital gain distributions.
• Dividends paid on deposits with mutual savings banks, cooperative banks, credit unions, 
U.S. building and loan associations, U.S. savings and loan associations, federal savings 
and loan associations, and similar financial institutions. (Report these amounts as interest 
income.)
• Dividends  from  a  corporation  that  is  a  tax-exempt  organization  or  farmer’s  cooperative  
during  the  corporation’s  tax  year  in  which  the  dividends  were  paid  or  during  the  
corporation’s previous tax year.
• Dividends paid by a corporation on employer securities which are held on the date of 
record by an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) maintained by that corporation.
• Dividends on any share of stock to the extent that you are obligated (whether under a 
short sale or otherwise) to make related payments for positions in substantially similar or 
related property.
• Payments  in  lieu  of  dividends, but only if you know or have reason to know that the 
payments are not qualified dividends.
• Payments shown in Form 1099-DIV, box 1b, from a foreign corporation to the extent you 
know or have reason to know the payments are not qualified dividends.
I V.  CAPITAL GAIN DISTRIBUTIONS 
Capital gain distributions (also called capital gain dividends) are paid to you or credited to your account 
by mutual funds (or other regulated investment companies) and real estate investment trusts (REITs). 
They will be shown in box 2a of the Form 1099-DIV you receive from the mutual fund or REIT. 
Report capital gain distributions as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you owned your 
shares in the mutual fund or REIT.
Qualified Opportunity Fund. Effective December 22, 2017, IRC 1400Z-2 provides a temporary deferral 
of inclusion in gross income for capital gains invested in Qualified Opportunity Funds, and permanent 
exclusion of capital gains from the sale or exchange of an investment in the Qualified Opportunity Fund 

 62  •  Chapter 8: Dividends and Other Distributions
if the investment is held for at least 10 years. See Form 8949 instructions on how to report your election 
to defer eligible gains invested in a Qualified Opportunity Fund.
Qualified opportunity investment. If you held a qualified investment in a qualified opportunity fund 
(QOF) at any time during the year, you must file your return with Form 8997, Initial and Annual Statement 
of Qualified Opportunity Fund Investments, attached. See Form 8997 instructions.
Undistributed  capital  gains  of  mutual  funds  and  REITs.  Some mutual funds and REITs keep their 
long-term capital gains and pay tax on them. You must treat your share of these gains as distributions, 
even though you did not actually receive them. However, they are not included on Form 1099-DIV. 
Instead, they are reported to you in box 1a of Form 2439, Notice to Shareholder of Undistributed Long-
Term Capital Gains. 
Form 2439 also will show how much, if any, of the undistributed capital gains is unrecaptured Section 
1250 gain (box 1b), gain from qualified small business stock (Section 1202 gain, box 1c), or collectibles 
(28%) gain (box 1d). The tax paid on these gains by the mutual fund or REIT is shown in box 2 of Form 
2439.  
Basis adjustment. Increase your basis in your mutual fund, or your interest in a REIT, by the difference 
between the gain you report and the credit you claim for the tax paid.
V.   NONDIVIDEND DISTRIBUTIONS 
Basis adjustment. A nondividend distribution reduces the basis of your stock. It is not taxed until your 
basis in the stock is fully recovered. This nontaxable portion is also called a return of capital; it is a 
return of your investment in the stock of the company. If you buy stock in a corporation in different lots 
at different times, and you cannot definitely identify the shares subject to the nondividend distribution, 
reduce the basis of your earliest purchases first. 
When the basis of your stock has been reduced to zero, report any additional nondividend distribution 
that you receive as a capital gain. Whether you report it as a long-term or short-term capital gain depends 
on how long you have held the stock. See Holding Period in chapter 14. 
Example
You bought stock in 2010 for $100. In 2014, you received a nondividend distribution 
of $80. You did not include this amount in your income, but you reduced the basis of 
your stock to $20. You received a return of capital of $30 in 2024. The first $20 of this 
amount reduced your basis to zero. You report the other $10 as a long-term capital gain 
for 2024. You must report as a long-term capital gain any nondividend distribution you 
receive on this stock in later years.

 63  •  Chapter 8: Dividends and Other Distributions
LIQUIDATING DISTRIBUTIONS 
Liquidating distributions, sometimes called liquidating dividends, are distributions you receive during a 
partial or complete liquidation of a corporation. These distributions are, at least in part, one form of a 
return of capital. They may be paid in one or more installments. You will receive a Form 1099-DIV from 
the corporation showing you the amount of the liquidating distribution in box 9 or 10. 
VI. OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS 
You may receive any of the following distributions during the year. 
Exempt-interest dividends. Exempt-interest dividends  you  receive  from  a  mutual  fund  or  other  
regulated  investment  company  are  not  included  in  your  taxable  income.  Exempt-interest  dividends 
should be shown in box 12 of Form 1099-DIV. 
Information  reporting  requirement.  Although exempt-interest dividends  are  not  taxable,  you  must 
show them on your tax return if you have to file a return. This is an information reporting requirement and 
does not change the exempt-interest dividends to taxable income. 
Alternative  minimum  tax  treatment. Exempt-interest dividends  paid  from  specified  private  activity 
bonds may be subject to the alternative minimum tax. See Alternative  Minimum  Tax  in  chapter  29  for  
more information. 
Dividends on insurance policies. Insurance policy dividends that the insurer keeps and uses to pay 
your premiums are not taxable. However, you must report as taxable interest income the interest that is 
paid or credited on dividends left with the insurance company. 
If dividends on an insurance contract (other than a modified endowment contract) are distributed to you, 
they are a partial return of the premiums you paid. Do not include them in your gross income until they 
are more than the total of all net premiums you paid for the contract. 
Dividends  on  veterans’  insurance.  Dividends  you  receive  on  veterans’  insurance  policies  are  not  
taxable. In addition, interest on dividends left with the Department of Veterans Affairs is not taxable. 
Patronage dividends. Generally,  patronage dividends  you  receive  in  money  from  a  cooperative  
organization are included in your income. 
Do not include in your income patronage dividends you receive on: 
1. Property bought for your personal use, or 
2. Capital assets or depreciable property bought for use in your business. But you must 
reduce the basis (cost) of the items bought. If the dividend  is  more  than  the  adjusted  
basis of the assets, you must report the excess as income. 

 64  •  Chapter 8: Dividends and Other Distributions
These  rules  are  the  same  whether  the  cooperative  paying  the  dividend  is  a  taxable  or  tax-exempt 
cooperative. 
Alaska Permanent Fund dividends. Do not report these amounts as dividends. Instead, include these 
amounts on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8g.

 65  •  Chapter 8: Dividends and Other Distributions
CHAPTER 8: TEST YOUR KNOWLEDGE
The  following  questions  are  designed  to  ensure  that  you  have  a  complete  understanding  of  the  
information presented in the chapter (assignment). They are included as an additional tool to enhance 
your learning experience and do not need to be submitted in order to receive CPE credit. 
We recommend that you answer each question and then compare your response to the suggested

A. true
B. false

 66  •  Chapter 8: Dividends and Other Distributions
CHAPTER 8: SOLUTIONS AND SUGGESTED RESPONSES
Below are the solutions and suggested responses for the questions on the previous page(s). If you 
choose an incorrect answer, you should review the pages as indicated for each question to ensure 
comprehension of the material.
1.A. Incorrect. Ordinary (taxable) dividends are paid out of the earnings and profits of a 
corporation and are ordinary income to the taxpayer.
B. CORRECT. They are ordinary income rather than capital gain to the taxpayer.
(See page 61 of the course material.)
2.A. Incorrect. Payment of a dividend by a U.S. corporation, or a qualified foreign corporation, 
is one of three necessary tests to determine whether a dividend payment qualifies for 
the favorable tax rates of a qualified dividend.
B. CORRECT. Dividends paid on deposits with mutual savings banks, cooperative banks, 
credit unions, U.S. building and loan associations, and similar financial institutions do 
not qualify as qualified dividends.  They  therefore  are  not  included  in  any  three-factor  
test.
C. Incorrect. To meet one of the three tests to qualify as a qualified dividend, the dividend 
cannot be a capital gain distribution.
D. Incorrect. Meeting the holding period of the dividend’s underlying stock is one of three 
necessary tests needed to establish a qualifying dividend from other payments.
(See pages 62 to 63 of the course material.)
3.A. Incorrect.  If  dividends  on  an  insurance  contract  (other  than  a  modified  endowment 
contract) are distributed to the individual, they are a partial return of the premiums the 
individual paid. As such, they are not included in gross income until they are more than 
the total of all net premiums paid for the contract.
B. CORRECT. Only distributions greater than the total of all net premiums paid for the 
contract are taxable.
(See page 65 of the course material.)

 67  •  Chapter 9: Rental Income and Expenses
CHAPTER 9: RENTAL INCOME AND EXPENSES
Chapter Objective
After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• Recognize the proper treatment of rental property income and expenses for tax purposes.
I.   INTRODUCTION 
This chapter discusses rental income and expenses. It covers the following topics. 
• Personal use of dwelling unit (including vacation home). 
• Depreciation. 
• Limits on rental losses. 
II. RENTAL INCOME 
In most cases, you must include in your gross income all amounts you receive as rent. Rental income is 
any payment you receive for the use or occupation of property. It is not limited to amounts you receive as 
normal rent payments. 
When to report. If you are a cash basis taxpayer, report rental income on your return for the year you 
actually or constructively receive it, regardless of when it was earned. You constructively receive income 
when it is made available to you, for example, by being credited to your bank account. If you are an 
accrual basis taxpayer, you generally report income when you earn it, rather than when you receive it.
Advance rent. Advance rent is any amount you receive before the period that it covers. Include advance 
rent in your rental income in the year you receive it regardless of the period covered or the method of 
accounting you use. 
Example
You sign a 10-year lease to rent your property. In the first year, you receive $9,600 for 
the first year’s rent and $9,600 as rent for the last year of the lease. You must include 
$19,200 in your income in the first year.
Security deposits. Do not include a security deposit in your income when you receive it if you plan to 
return it to your tenant at the end of the lease. But if you keep part or all of the security deposit during 
any year because your tenant does not live up to the terms of the lease, include the amount you keep in 
your income in that year. 

 68  •  Chapter 9: Rental Income and Expenses
If an amount called a security deposit is to be used as a final payment of rent, it is advance rent. Include 
it in your income when you receive it. 
Payment  for  canceling  a  lease.  If your tenant pays you to cancel a lease, the amount you receive 
is  rent.  Include  the  payment  in  your  income  in  the  year  you  receive  it  regardless  of  your  method  of  
accounting. 
Expenses paid by tenant. If your tenant pays any of your expenses, those payments are rental income. 
You  must  include  them  in  your  income. You  can  deduct  the  expenses  if  they  are  deductible rental 
expenses. See Rental Expenses, later, for more information. 
Property  or  services. If you receive property or services, instead of money, as rent, include the fair 
market value of the property or services in your rental income. 
If the services are provided at an agreed upon or specified price, that price is the fair market value 
unless there is evidence to the contrary. 
Rental of property also used as a home. If you rent property that you also use as your home and you 
rent it fewer than 15 days during the tax year, do not include the rent you receive in your income and do 
not deduct rental expenses. However, you can deduct on Schedule A (Form 1040) the interest, taxes, 
and casualty and theft losses that are allowed for nonrental property. See Personal Use of Dwelling Unit 
(Including Vacation Home), later. 
Part interest. If you own a part interest in rental property, you must report your part of the rental income 
from the property.
III. RENTAL EXPENSES 
This part discusses repairs and certain other expenses of renting property that you ordinarily can deduct 
from your rental income. It includes information on the expenses you can deduct if you rent part of your 
property, or if you change your property to rental use. Depreciation, which you can also deduct from your 
rental income, is discussed later. 
When  to  deduct.  If you are a cash basis taxpayer, you generally deduct your rental  expenses  in  the  
year you pay them. If you are an accrual basis taxpayer, you generally deduct your expenses when you 
incur them, rather than when you pay them.
Vacant rental property. If you hold property for rental purposes, you may be able to deduct your ordinary 
and necessary expenses (including depreciation) for managing, conserving, or maintaining the property 
while the property is vacant. However, you cannot deduct any loss of rental income for the period the 
property is vacant.
Vacant  while  listed  for  sale. If you sell property you held for rental purposes, you can deduct the 
ordinary and necessary expenses for managing, conserving, or maintaining the property until it is sold. 
If the property is not held out and available for rent while listed for sale, the expenses are not deductible 
rental expenses. 

 69  •  Chapter 9: Rental Income and Expenses
Pre-rental expenses. You can deduct your ordinary and necessary expenses for managing, conserving, 
or maintaining rental property from the time you make it available for rent. 
Personal use of rental property. If you sometimes use your rental property for personal purposes, you 
must divide your expenses between rental and personal use. Also, your rental expense deductions may 
be limited. See Personal Use of Dwelling Unit (Including Vacation Home), later. 
Part  interest. If you own a part interest in rental property, you can deduct expenses that you paid 
according to your percentage of ownership. 
Uncollected rent. If you are a cash basis taxpayer, you do not deduct uncollected rent. Because you do 
not include it in your income, it is not deductible.
Depreciation. You can begin to depreciate rental property when it is ready and available for rent. See 
Placed-in-Service Date under Depreciation, later.
REPAIRS AND IMPROVEMENTS 
Generally, an expense for repairing or maintaining your rental property may be deducted if you are not 
required to capitalize the expense. 
Improvements. You must capitalize any expense you pay to improve your rental property. An expense 
is for an improvement if it results in a betterment to your property, restores your property, or adapts your 
property to a new or different use.
Betterments. Expenses that may result in a betterment to your property include expenses for fixing 
a  pre-existing  defect  or  condition,  enlarging  or  expanding  your  property,  or  increasing  the  capacity, 
strength, or quality of your property.
Restoration. Expenses that may be for restoration include expenses for replacing a substantial structural 
part of your property, repairing damage to your property after you properly adjusted the basis of your 
property as a result of a casualty loss, or rebuilding your property to a like-new condition.
Adaptation. Expenses  that  may  be  for  adaptation  include  expenses  for  altering  your  property  to  a 
use that is not consistent with the intended ordinary use of your property when you began renting the 
property.
Safe  harbor  for  routine  maintenance.  If  you  determine  that  your  cost  was  for  an  improvement  to  a  
building or equipment, you still may be able to deduct your cost under the routine maintenance safe 
harbor. 
Note
Separate the costs of repairs and improvements, and keep accurate records. You will 
need to know the cost of improvements when you sell or depreciate your property. The 
expenses you capitalize for improving your property generally can be depreciated as if 
the improvement were separate property.

 70  •  Chapter 9: Rental Income and Expenses
Safe Harbors under the IRS Regulations
The final regulations provide for three safe harbors related to improvements. They are a de minimis safe 
harbor, a safe harbor for small taxpayers, and a safe harbor for routine maintenance. If a safe harbor 
applies, a current deduction is allowed. The de  minimis and small taxpayer safe harbors are annual 
elections made on a statement to be attached to the return, and not a change in accounting method.
De  minimis  safe  harbor.  This safe harbor allows you to elect to apply a de  minimis safe harbor to 
amounts  paid to acquire  or produce  tangible  property  to the extent such amounts  are deducted  by 
you for financial accounting purposes or in keeping your books and records. If you have an applicable 
financial statement (AFS), you may use this safe harbor to deduct amounts paid for tangible property up 
to $5,000 per invoice or item (as substantiated by invoice). If you do not have an AFS, you may use the 
safe harbor to deduct amounts up to $2,500 per invoice or item (as substantiated by invoice). The de 
minimis safe harbor does not include amounts paid for inventory and land.
Small taxpayer safe harbor. This safe harbor allows small taxpayers to not capitalize an improvement, 
and therefore to deduct such costs of work performed on owned or leased buildings. In order to qualify, 
the requirements for small taxpayers are:
• Average annual gross receipts of $10 million or less; and
• Owns or leases building property with an unadjusted basis of $1 million or less; and
• The total amount paid during the taxable year for repairs, maintenance, improvements, 
or similar activities performed on such building property does not exceed the lesser of (1) 
two percent of the unadjusted basis of the eligible building property, or (2) $10,000.
Routine  maintenance  safe  harbor. This safe harbor allows you to deduct expenses if the amounts 
meet all of the following criteria:
• Amounts paid for recurring activities that you expect to perform;
• As a result of your use of the property in your trade or business;
• To keep the property in its ordinarily efficient operating condition; and
• You  reasonably  expect,  at  the  time  the  property  is  placed  in  service,  to  perform  the 
activities (1) for building structures and building systems, more than once during the 10-
year period beginning when placed in service, or (2) for property other than buildings, 
more than once during the class life of the unit of property.
The routine maintenance safe harbor does not apply to amounts paid for betterments, but does apply to 
certain restorations that would otherwise be improvements, including when you pay amounts to replace 
a major component or substantial structural part of a unit of property.

 71  •  Chapter 9: Rental Income and Expenses
OTHER EXPENSES 
Other expenses you can deduct from your rental income include advertising, cleaning and maintenance,  
utilities, fire and liability insurance, taxes, interest, commissions for the collection of rent, ordinary and 
necessary travel and transportation, and other expenses, discussed next. 
Rental of property. You can deduct the rent you pay for property that you use for rental purposes. If you 
buy a leasehold for rental purposes, you can deduct an equal part of the cost each year over the term of 
the lease. 
Rental of equipment. You can deduct the rent you pay for equipment that you use for rental purposes. 
However, in some cases, lease contracts are actually purchase contracts. If so, you cannot deduct these 
payments. You can recover the cost of purchased equipment through depreciation. 
Insurance  premiums  paid  in  advance.  If  you  pay  an  insurance  premium  for  more  than  one  year  in  
advance, you cannot deduct the total premium in the year you pay it. For each year of coverage, you 
deduct only the part of the premium payment that applies to that year.
Local benefits taxes. In most cases, you cannot deduct charges for local benefits that increase the 
value of your property, such as charges for putting in streets, sidewalks, or water and sewer systems. 
These  charges  are  nondepreciable  capital  expenditures,  and  must  be  added  to  the  basis  of  your 
property. However, you can deduct local benefit taxes if they are for maintaining, repairing, or paying 
interest charges for the benefits. 
Travel expenses. You can deduct the ordinary and necessary expenses of traveling away from home 
if the primary purpose of the trip was to collect rental income or to manage, conserve, or maintain your 
rental property. You must properly allocate your expenses between rental and nonrental activities. You 
cannot  deduct  the  cost  of  traveling  away  from  home  if  the  primary  purpose  of  the  trip  was  to  improve  
your property. For information on travel expenses, see chapter 20. 
Local transportation  expenses.  You  may  be  able  to  deduct  your  ordinary  and  necessary  local 
transportation expenses if you incur them to collect rental income or to manage, conserve, or maintain 
your rental property. However, transportation expenses incurred to travel between your home and a 
rental property generally constitute nondeductible commuting costs unless you use your home as your 
principal place of business.
Generally, if you use your personal car, pickup truck, or light van for rental activities, you can deduct 
the expenses using one of two methods: actual expenses or the standard mileage rate. For 2024, the 
standard mileage rate for all business travel is 67.0 cents per mile. 
Records. To deduct car expenses under either method, you must keep records that follow the rules in 
chapter 20.

I V.  PERSONAL  USE  OF  DWELLING  UNIT  (INCLUDING  VACATION  
HOME) 
If you have any personal use of a dwelling unit (including a vacation home) that you rent, you must 
divide your expenses between rental use and personal use. In general, your rental expenses will be no 
more than your total expenses multiplied by a fraction; the denominator of which is the total number of 
days the dwelling unit is used and the numerator of which is the total number of days actually rented at a 
fair rental price. Only your rental expenses may be deducted on Schedule E (Form 1040). Some of your 
personal expenses may be deductible if you itemize your deductions on Schedule A (Form 1040).
You must also determine if the dwelling unit is considered a home. The amount of rental expenses that 
you can deduct may be limited if the dwelling unit is considered a home. Whether a dwelling unit is 
considered a home depends on how many days during the year are considered to be days of personal 
use. There is a special rule if you used the dwelling unit as a home and you rented it for less than 15 
days during the year.
Dwelling unit. A dwelling unit includes a house, apartment, condominium, mobile home, boat, vacation 
home, or similar property. A dwelling unit has basic living accommodations, such as sleeping space, a 
toilet, and cooking facilities. 
A dwelling unit does not include property used solely as a hotel, motel, inn, or similar establishment. 
Property is used solely as a hotel, motel, inn, or similar establishment if it is regularly available for 
occupancy by paying customers and is not used by an owner as a home during the year. 
Example
You  rent  a  room  in  your  home  that  is  always  available  for  short-term  occupancy 
by paying customers. You do not use the room yourself, and you allow only paying 
customers to use the room. The room is used solely as a hotel, motel, inn, or similar 
establishment and is not a dwelling unit.
DWELLING UNIT USED AS HOME 
The  tax  treatment  of  rental income and expenses for a dwelling unit that you use for both rental and 
personal purposes depends on whether you are considered to be using the dwelling unit as a home. 
You use a dwelling unit as a home during the tax year if you use it for personal purposes more than the 
greater of:  
1. 14 days, or 
2. 10% of the total days it is rented to others at a fair rental price. 
See What is a day of personal use, later. 

 73  •  Chapter 9: Rental Income and Expenses
If a dwelling unit is used for personal purposes on a day it is rented at a fair rental price, do not count that 
day as a day of rental use in applying (2) above. Instead, count it as a day of personal use in applying 
both (1) and (2) above. This rule does not apply when dividing expenses between rental and personal 
use.
Fair rental price. A fair rental price for your property generally is the amount of rent that a person who is 
not related to you would be willing to pay. The rent you charge is not a fair rental price if it is substantially 
less than the rents charged for other properties that are similar to your property in your area.
WHAT IS A DAY OF PERSONAL USE? 
A day of personal use of a dwelling unit is any day that it is used by any of the following persons.
1. You or any other person who has an interest in it, unless you rent it to another owner as 
his or her main home under a shared equity financing agreement (defined later). 
2. A  member  of  your  family  or  a  member  of  the  family  of  any  other  person  who  has  a 
financial interest in it, unless the family member uses the dwelling unit as his or her main 
home and pays a fair rental price. Family includes only brothers and sisters, half-brothers 
and half-sisters, spouses, ancestors (parents, grandparents, etc.) and lineal descendants 
(children, grandchildren, etc.). 
3. Anyone under an arrangement that lets you use some other dwelling unit. 
4. Anyone at less than a fair rental price.  
Main home. If the other person or member of the family in (1) or (2) above has more than one home, his 
or her main home is ordinarily the one lived in most of the time. 
Shared equity financing agreement. This is an agreement under which two or more persons acquire 
undivided interests for more than 50 years in an entire dwelling unit, including the land, and one or more 
of the co-owners is entitled to occupy the unit as his or her main home upon payment of rent to the other 
co-owner or owners. 
Donation of use of property. You use a dwelling unit for personal purposes if: 
• You donate the use of the unit to a charitable organization, 
• The organization sells the use of the unit at a fund-raising event, and 
• The “purchaser” uses the unit. 
Examples 
The following examples show how to determine days of personal use. 

 74  •  Chapter 9: Rental Income and Expenses
Example 1
You and your neighbor are co-owners of a condominium at the beach. Last year, you 
rented the unit to vacationers whenever possible. The unit was not used as a main home 
by anyone. Your neighbor used the unit for two weeks last year; you did not use it at all.
Because your neighbor has an interest in the unit, both of you are considered to have 
used the unit for personal purposes during those 2 weeks. 
Example 2
You and your neighbors are co-owners of a house under a shared equity financing 
agreement. Your neighbors live in the house and pay you a fair rental price.
Even though your neighbors have an interest in the house, the days your neighbors live 
there are not counted as days of personal use by you. This is because your neighbors 
rent the house as their main home under a shared equity financing agreement.
Example 3
You own a rental property that you rent to your son. Your son does not own any interest 
in this property. He uses it as his main home. He pays you a fair rental price for the 
property.
Your son’s use of the property is not personal use by you because your son is using it as 
his main home, he owns no interest in the property, and he is paying you a fair rental 
price. 
Example 4
You rent your beach house to Joshua. Joshua rents his house in the mountains to you. 
You each pay a fair rental price.
You are using your house for personal purposes on the days that Joshua uses it because 
your house is used by Joshua under an arrangement that allows you to use his house. 
Days Used for Repairs and Maintenance 
Any day that you spend working substantially full time repairing and maintaining your property is not 
counted  as  a  day  of  personal  use.  Do  not  count  such  a  day  as  a  day  of  personal  use  even  if  family  
members use the property for recreational purposes on the same day.

 75  •  Chapter 9: Rental Income and Expenses
Days Used as Main Home Before or After Renting 
For purposes of determining whether a dwelling unit was used as a home, you may not have to count 
days you used the property as your main home before or after renting it or offering it for rent as days of 
personal use. Do not count them as days of personal use if: 
1. You rented or tried to rent the property for 12 or more consecutive months. 
2. You rented or tried to rent the property for a period of less than 12 consecutive months 
and the period ended because you sold or exchanged the property. 
This special rule does not apply when dividing expenses between rental and personal use.
Examples 
The following examples show how to determine whether you used your rental property as a home. 
Example 1
You  converted  the  basement  of  your  home  into  an  apartment  with  a  bedroom,  a 
bathroom, and a small kitchen. You rented the basement apartment at a fair rental price 
to college students during the regular school year. You rented to them on a 9-month 
lease (273 days). You figured 10% of the total days rented to others at a fair rental price 
is 27 days.
During  June  (30  days),  your  brothers  stayed  with  you  and  lived  in  the  basement 
apartment rent free.
Your basement apartment was used as a home because you used it for personal purposes 
for 30 days. Rent-free use by your brother is considered personal use. Your personal 
use (30 days) is more than the greater of 14 days or 10% of the total days it was rented 
(27 days). 
Example 2
You rented the guest room in your home at a fair rental price during the local college’s 
homecoming, commencement, and football weekends (a total of 27 days). Your sister-
in-law stayed in the room, rent free, for the last 3 weeks (21 days) in July. You figured 
10% of the total days rented to others at a fair rental price is 3 days.
The room was used as a home because you used it for personal purposes for 21 days. 
That is more than the greater of 14 days or 10% of the 27 days it was rented (3 days).

 76  •  Chapter 9: Rental Income and Expenses
Example 3
You own a condominium apartment in a resort area. You rented it at a fair rental price 
for a total of 170 days during the year. For 12 of those days, the tenant was not able 
to use the apartment and allowed you to use it even though you did not refund any of 
the rent. Your family actually used the apartment for 10 of those days. Therefore, the 
apartment is treated as having been rented for 160 (170 - 10) days. You figured 10% of 
the total days rented to others at a fair rental price is 16 days. Your family also used the 
apartment for 7 other days during the year.
You used the apartment as a home because you used it for personal purposes for 17 
days. That is more than the greater of 14 days or 10% of the 160 days it was rented (16 
days). 
HOW TO DIVIDE EXPENSES 
If you use a dwelling unit for both rental and personal purposes, divide your expenses between the 
rental use and the personal use based on the number of days used for each purpose. 
When dividing your expenses follow these rules.  
1. Any  day  that  the  unit  is  rented  at  a  fair  rental  price  is  a  day  of  rental  use  even  if  you  
used the unit for personal purposes that day. This rule does not apply when determining 
whether you used the unit as a home. 
2. Any day that the unit is available for rent but not actually rented is not a day of rental use. 
Example
Your beach cottage was available for rent from June 1 through August 31 (92 days). 
During that time, except for the first week in August (7 days) when you were unable to 
find a renter, you rented the cottage at a fair rental price. The person who rented the 
cottage for July allowed you to use it over a weekend (2 days) without any reduction in 
or refund of rent. Your family also used the cottage during the last 2 weeks of May (14 
days). The cottage was not used at all before May 17 or after August 31.
You figure the part of the cottage expenses to treat as rental expenses as follows.
1. The cottage was used for rental a total of 85 days (92 - 7). The days it was 
available for rent but not rented (7 days) are not days of rental use. The 
July weekend (2 days) you used it is rental use because you received a 
fair rental price for the weekend.

 77  •  Chapter 9: Rental Income and Expenses
Example (continued)
2. You used the cottage for personal purposes for 14 days (the last 2 weeks 
in May). 
3. The total use of the cottage was 99 days (14 days personal use + 85 days 
rental use). 
4. Your rental expenses are 85/99 (86%) of the cottage expenses. 
When determining whether you used the cottage as a home, the July weekend (2 days) 
you used it is personal use even though you received a fair rental price for the weekend. 
Therefore, you had 16 days of personal use and 83 days of rental use for this purpose. 
Because you used the cottage for personal purposes more than 14 days and more than 
10% of the days of rental use (8 days), you used it as a home. If you have a net loss, you 
may not be able to deduct all of the rental expenses.
V.   DEPRECIATION 
You  recover  your  cost  in  income  producing  property  through  yearly  tax  deductions. You  do  this  by 
depreciating the property; that is, by deducting some of your cost on your tax return each year. 
Three basic factors determine how much depreciation you can deduct. They are: (1) your basis in the 
property, (2) the recovery period for the property, and (3) the depreciation method used. You cannot 
simply deduct your mortgage or principal payments, or the cost of furniture, fixtures and equipment, as 
an expense. 
You  can  deduct  depreciation  only  on  the  part  of  your  property  used  for  rental  purposes.  Depreciation  
reduces your basis for figuring gain or loss on a later sale or exchange. 
You may have to use Form 4562 to figure and report your depreciation.
Section  179  deduction.  The  section  179  deduction  is  a  means  of  recovering  part  or  all  of  the  cost  
of  certain  qualifying  property  in  the  year  you  place  the  property  in  service.  It  is  separate  from  your  
depreciation deduction.
Alternative minimum tax (AMT). If you use accelerated depreciation, you may be subject to the AMT. 
Accelerated depreciation allows you to deduct more depreciation earlier in the recovery period than you 
could deduct using a straight line method (same deduction each year).
Claiming  the  correct  amount  of  depreciation.  You  should  claim  the  correct  amount  of  depreciation  
each tax year. If you did not claim all the depreciation that you were entitled to deduct, you must still 
reduce your basis in the property by the full amount of depreciation that you could have deducted. 
If you deducted an incorrect amount of depreciation for property in any year, you may be able to make 
a correction for that year by filing Form 1040-X. If you are not allowed to make the correction on an 
amended return, you can change your accounting method to claim the correct amount of depreciation.

 78  •  Chapter 9: Rental Income and Expenses
Changing your accounting method to deduct unclaimed depreciation. To change your accounting 
method, you must file Form 3115, Application for Change in Accounting Method, to get the consent of 
the IRS. In some instances, that consent is automatic. 
Land. You can never depreciate the cost of land because land does not wear out, become obsolete, or 
get used up. The costs of clearing, grading, planting, and landscaping are usually all part of the cost of 
land and are not depreciable. 
DEPRECIATION METHODS 
There are three ways to figure depreciation. The depreciation method you use depends on the type of 
property and when the property was placed in service. For property used in rental activities you use one 
of the following. 
• MACRS  (Modified Accelerated  Cost  Recovery  System) for  property  placed  in  service  
after 1986. 
• ACRS (Accelerated Cost Recovery System) for property placed in service after 1980 but 
before 1987.
• Useful lives and either straight line or an accelerated method of depreciation, such as the 
declining balance method, if placed in service before 1981.
If  you  placed  rental  property  in  service  before  2024,  continue  to  use  the  same  method  of  figuring 
depreciation that you used in the past. 
Cooperative apartments. If you are a tenant-stockholder in a cooperative housing corporation and rent 
your cooperative apartment to others, you can deduct depreciation for the apartment even though it is 
owned by the corporation. Your depreciation deduction is your share of the corporation’s depreciation. 
MACRS 
Most business and investment property placed in service after 1986 is depreciated using MACRS. 
MACRS  consists  of  two  systems  that  determine  how  you  depreciate  your  property.  The  main  system  
is  called  the  General  Depreciation  System  (GDS).  The  second  system  is  called  the  Alternative 
Depreciation  System  (ADS). GDS is used to figure your depreciation deduction for property used in 
most rental activities, unless you elect to use ADS. 
To figure your MACRS deduction, you need to know the following information about your property:  
1. Its recovery class,
2. Its applicable recovery period,
3. Its convention,
4. Its placed-in-service date,  

 79  •  Chapter 9: Rental Income and Expenses
5. Its depreciable basis, and
6. Its depreciation method.
Section 179 election. You cannot claim the section 179 deduction for property held to produce rental 
income (unless renting property is your trade or business).
Qualified real property. Although  most  real  property  is  not  eligible  for  the  section  179  deduction, 
qualified real property is eligible. Under prior law, qualified real property generally consisted of qualified 
leasehold improvements, qualified restaurant property, and qualified retail improvements.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act significantly expands the definition of qualified real property that taxpayers 
may elect to treat as section 179 property. Effective for tax years beginning after 2017, qualified real 
property is defined as:
1. Qualified improvement property; and
2. Any  of  the  following  improvements  to  nonresidential  real  property  that  are  placed  in  
service after the nonresidential real property was first placed in service:
• Roofs;
• Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning property;
• Fire protection and alarm systems; and
• Security systems.
Exclusion for property used in connection with lodging. Effective for property placed in service in 
tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, property that is used predominantly to furnish lodging or 
in connection with the furnishing of lodging qualifies for section 179 expensing.
The primary impact of this provision is to allow expensing of section 1245 property purchased for use in 
connection with a residential rental building.  Examples of property used in connection with the furnishing 
of lodging include lobby furniture, office equipment, and laundry and swimming pool equipment. Property 
used in furnishing electrical energy, water, sewage disposal services, gas, telephone service, or similar 
services are not used in connection with the furnishing of lodging.
No deduction greater than basis. The total of all your yearly depreciation deductions cannot be more 
than the cost or other basis of the property. For this purpose, your yearly depreciation deductions include 
any depreciation that you were allowed to claim, even if you did not claim it. 
Personal home changed to rental use. You must use MACRS to figure the depreciation on property 
you used as your home and changed to rental property in 2024. 
Excluded  property.  You  cannot  use  MACRS  for  certain  personal  property  placed  in  service  in  your  
rental property in 2024 if it had been previously placed in service before MACRS became effective in 
1987 (before August 1, 1986, if election made). 

 80  •  Chapter 9: Rental Income and Expenses
Recovery Periods Under GDS 
Each item of property that can be depreciated is assigned to a property class. The recovery period of 
the property depends on the class the property is in. Under GDS, the recovery period of an asset is 
generally the same as its property class. The property classes under GDS are: 
• 3-year property, 
• 5-year property, 
• 7-year property, 
• 10-year property, 
• 15-year property, 
• 20-year property, 
• Nonresidential real property, and 
• Residential rental property. 
Recovery periods for property used in rental activities are shown in Table 9-1, next.

Additions and improvements, such as a new roofThe same recovery period as that of the 
property to which the addition or improvement 
is made, determined as if the property were 
placed in service at the same time as the 
addition or improvement.
Additions  or  improvements  to  property.  Treat depreciable additions or improvements you make to 
any property as separate property items for depreciation purposes. The recovery period for an addition 
or improvement to property begins on the later of:  
1. The date the addition or improvement is placed in service, or 
2. The date the property to which the addition or improvement was made is placed in service. 
The class and recovery period of the addition or improvement is the one that would apply to the original 
property if it were placed in service at the same time as the addition or improvement. 
Example
You  own  a  residential  rental  house  that  you  have  been  renting  since  1987  and 
depreciating under ACRS. You built an addition onto the house and placed it in service 
in 2024. You must use MACRS for the addition. Under GDS, the addition is depreciated 
as residential rental property over 27.5 years.

 82  •  Chapter 9: Rental Income and Expenses
Placed-in-Service Date 
You can begin to depreciate property when you place it in service in your trade or business or for the 
production of income. Property is considered placed in service in a rental activity when it is ready and 
available for a specific use in that activity. 
Depreciable Basis 
To deduct the proper  amount of depreciation  each year, you must first determine  your basis in the 
property you intend to depreciate. The basis used for figuring depreciation is your original basis in the 
property increased by any additions or improvements made to the property. Your original basis is usually 
your cost. However, if you acquire the property in some other way, such as by inheriting it, getting it as a 
gift, or building it yourself, you may have to figure your original basis in another way. Other adjustments 
could also affect your basis. See chapter 13. 
Conventions 
Under  MACRS,  conventions  establish  when  the  recovery  period  begins  and  ends.  The  convention 
you use determines the number of months for which you can claim depreciation in the year you place 
property in service and in the year you dispose of the property. 
Mid-month  convention.  A  mid-month  convention  is  used  for  all  residential  rental  property  and  
nonresidential real property. Under this convention, you treat all property placed in service, or disposed 
of, during any month as placed in service, or disposed of, at the midpoint of that month.
Mid-quarter  convention.  A mid-quarter convention must be used if the mid-month convention does 
not apply and the total depreciable basis of MACRS property you placed in service in the last 3 months 
of a tax year (excluding nonresidential real property, residential rental property, and property placed in 
service and disposed of in the same year) is more than 40% of the total basis of all such property you 
place in service during the tax year. 
Under this convention, you treat all property placed in service, or disposed of, during any quarter of a tax 
year as placed in service, or disposed of, at the midpoint of the quarter.
Half-year  convention.  The  half-year  convention  is  used  if  neither  the  mid-quarter  convention  nor  
the mid-month convention applies. Under this convention, you treat all property placed in service, or 
disposed of, during a tax year as placed in service, or disposed of, at the midpoint of that tax year. 
If this convention applies, you deduct a half-year of depreciation for the first year and the last year that 
you depreciate the property. You deduct a full year of depreciation for any other year during the recovery 
period. 

 83  •  Chapter 9: Rental Income and Expenses
Example
During the tax year, Jordan purchased the following items to use in his rental property.
• A dishwasher for $400 that he placed in service in January. 
• Used furniture for $100 that he placed in service in September. 
• A refrigerator for $800 that he placed in service in October. 
Jordan uses the calendar year as his tax year. The total basis of all property placed 
in service in that year is $1,300. The $800 basis of the refrigerator placed in service 
during the last 3 months of his tax year exceeds $520 (40% × $1,300). Jordan must 
use the mid-quarter convention instead of the half-year convention for all three items. 
MACRS DEPRECIATION UNDER GDS 
You can figure your MACRS depreciation deduction under GDS in one of two ways. The deduction is 
substantially the same both ways. (The difference, if any, is slight.) You can either:  
1. Use the percentage from the optional MACRS tables, see Table 9-2, or 
2. Actually figure the deduction using the depreciation method and convention that apply 
over the recovery period of the property.

USING THE OPTIONAL TABLES 
You can use the tables in Table 9-2 to compute annual depreciation under MACRS. The tables show the 
percentages for the first 6 years. The percentages in Tables 9-2-A, 9-2-B, and 9-2-C make the change 
from declining balance to straight line in the year that straight line will yield an equal or larger deduction. 
How to use the tables. The following section explains how to use the optional tables. 
Figure the depreciation deduction by multiplying your unadjusted basis in the property by the percentage 
shown in the appropriate table. Your unadjusted basis is your depreciable basis without reduction for 
depreciation previously claimed. 
Once you begin using an optional table to figure depreciation, you must continue to use it for the entire 
recovery period unless there is an adjustment to the basis of your property for a reason other than:  
1. Depreciation allowed or allowable, or 
2. An addition or improvement that is depreciated as a separate item of property. 
Tables  9-2-A,  9-2-B,  and  9-2-C. The percentages in these tables take into account the half-year and 
mid-quarter conventions. Use Table 9-2-A for 5-year property, Table 9-2-B for 7-year property, and Table 
9-2-C for 15-year property. Use the percentage in the second column (half-year convention) unless you 
must use the mid-quarter convention (explained earlier). If you must use the mid-quarter convention, use 
the column that corresponds to the calendar year quarter in which you placed the property in service. 
Example 1
You purchased a stove and refrigerator and placed them in service in June. Your basis in 
the stove is $600 and your basis in the refrigerator is $1,000. Both are 5-year property. 
Using  the  half-year  convention  column  in Table  9-2-A,  you  find  the  depreciation 
percentage for year 1 is 20%. For that year, your depreciation deduction is $120 ($600 
× .20) for the stove and $200 ($1,000 × .20) for the refrigerator.
For year 2, you find your depreciation percentage is 32%. That year’s depreciation 
deduction will be $192 ($600 × .32) for the stove and $320 ($1,000 × .32) for the 
refrigerator. 

 86  •  Chapter 9: Rental Income and Expenses
Example 2
Assume the same facts as in Example  1, except you buy the refrigerator in October 
instead of June. You must use the mid-quarter convention to figure depreciation on the 
stove and refrigerator. The refrigerator was placed in service in the last 3 months of the 
tax year and its basis ($1,000) is more than 40% of the total basis of all property placed 
in service during the year ($1,600 × .40 = $640).
Because you placed the refrigerator in service in October, you use the fourth quarter 
column of Table 9-2-A and find that the depreciation percentage for year 1 is 5%. Your 
depreciation deduction for the refrigerator is $50 ($1,000 × .05). 
Because you placed the stove in service in June, you use the second quarter column of 
Table 9-2-A and find that the depreciation percentage for year 1 is 25%. For that year, 
your depreciation deduction for the stove is $150 ($600 × .25). 
Table 9-2-D. Use this table for residential rental property. Find the row for the month that you placed the 
property in service. Use the percentages listed for that month to figure your depreciation deduction. The 
mid-month convention is taken into account in the percentages shown in the table. 
Example 
You purchased a single family rental house for $185,000 and placed it in service on 
February 8. Your basis in the house is $160,000. Using Table 9-2-D, you find that the 
percentage for property placed in service in February of year 1 is 3.182%. That year’s 
depreciation deduction is $5,091 ($160,000 × .03182). 
MACRS DEPRECIATION UNDER ADS 
If you choose, you can use the ADS method for most property. Under ADS, you use the straight line 
method of depreciation. 
Table  9-1  shows  the  recovery  periods  for  property  used  in  rental  activities  that  you  depreciate  under  
ADS. If your property is not listed, it is considered to have no class life. Under ADS, personal property 
with no class life is depreciated using a recovery period of 12 years. 
Use the mid-month convention for residential rental property and nonresidential real property. For all 
other property, use the half-year or mid-quarter convention. 
Election. For property placed in service during 2024, you choose to use ADS by entering the depreciation 
on line 20c, Part III of Form 4562. 
The election of ADS for one item in a class of property generally applies to all property in that class that 
is placed in service during the tax year of the election. However, the election applies on a property-by-
property basis for residential rental property and nonresidential real property. 

 87  •  Chapter 9: Rental Income and Expenses
Once you choose to use ADS, you cannot change your election. 
OTHER RULES ABOUT DEPRECIABLE PROPERTY 
In addition to the rules about what methods you can use, there are other rules you should be aware of 
with respect to depreciable property. 
Gain  from  disposition. If you dispose of depreciable property at a gain, you may have to report, as 
ordinary income, all or part of the gain. 
Alternative  minimum  tax.  If  you  use  accelerated  depreciation,  you  may  have  to  file  Form  6251. 
Accelerated depreciation includes MACRS, ACRS, and any other method that allows you to deduct 
more depreciation than you could deduct using a straight line method.
VI. LIMITS ON RENTAL LOSSES 
If you have a loss from your rental real estate activity, two sets of rules may limit the amount of loss you 
can report on Schedule E. You must consider these rules in the order shown below.
1. At-risk rules. These rules are applied first if there is investment in your rental real estate 
activity for which you are not at risk. This applies only if the real property was placed in 
service after 1986.
2. Passive  activity  limits.  Generally,  rental  real  estate  activities  are  considered  passive 
activities  and  losses  are  not  deductible  unless  you  have  income  from  other  passive 
activities to offset them. However, there are exceptions.
Excess business loss limitation. The excess business loss limitation under section 461(1) is extended 
and applies to tax years beginning after December 31, 2020 and before January 1, 2029. For 2024, the 
amount is $305,000 ($610,000 for joint returns).
AT-RISK RULES 
You may be subject to the at-risk rules if you have:
• A loss from an activity carried on as a trade or business or for the production of income, 
and
• Amounts invested in the activity for which you are not fully at risk.
Losses from holding real property (other than mineral property) placed in service before 1987 are not 
subject to the at-risk rules.
In most cases, any loss from an activity subject to the at-risk rules is allowed only to the extent of the 
total amount you have at risk in the activity at the end of the tax year. You are considered at risk in an 
activity to the extent of cash and the adjusted basis of other property you contributed to the activity and 
certain amounts borrowed for use in the activity.

 88  •  Chapter 9: Rental Income and Expenses
PASSIVE ACTIVITY LIMITS 
In  most  cases,  all  rental  real  estate  activities  (except  those  meeting  the  exception  for  real  estate 
professionals, below) are passive activities. For this purpose, a rental activity is an activity from which 
you receive income mainly for the use of tangible property, rather than for services. 
Limits  on  passive  activity  deductions  and  credits.  Deductions  for  losses  from  passive  activities  
are limited. You generally cannot offset income, other than passive income, with losses from passive 
activities. Nor can you offset taxes on income, other than passive income, with credits resulting from 
passive activities. Any excess loss or credit is carried forward to the next tax year. 
You may have to complete Form 8582 to figure the amount of any passive activity loss for the current tax 
year for all activities and the amount of the passive activity loss allowed on your tax return.
Real estate professionals. Rental activities in which you materially participated during the year are not 
passive activities if, for that year, you were a real estate professional.
Exception for Personal Use of Dwelling Unit
If you used the rental property as a home during the year, any income, deductions, gain, or loss allocable 
to such use is not taken into account for purposes of the passive activity loss limitation. Instead, follow 
the rules explained in Personal Use of Dwelling Unit (Including Vacation Home), earlier.
Exception for Rental Real Estate Activities with Active Participation 
If you or your spouse actively participated in a passive rental real estate activity, you may be able to 
deduct up to $25,000 of loss from the activity from your nonpassive income. This special allowance is 
an exception to the general rule disallowing losses in excess of income from passive activities. Similarly, 
you can offset credits from the activity against the tax on up to $25,000 of nonpassive income after 
taking into account any losses allowed under this exception. 
Active  participation.  You  actively  participated  in  a  rental  real  estate  activity  if  you  (and  your  spouse)  
owned at least 10% of the rental property and you made management decisions or arranged for others to 
provide services (such as repairs) in a significant and bona fide sense. Management decisions that count 
as active participation include approving new tenants, deciding on rental terms, approving expenditures, 
and other similar decisions.
Maximum special allowance. The maximum special allowance is:
• $25,000 for single individuals and married individuals filing a joint return for the tax year,
• $12,500 for married individuals who file separate returns for the tax year and lived apart 
from their spouses at all times during the tax year, and
• $25,000 for a qualifying estate reduced by the special allowance for which the surviving 
spouse qualified.

 89  •  Chapter 9: Rental Income and Expenses
If your modified adjusted gross income is $100,000 or less ($50,000 or less if married filing separately), 
you can deduct your loss up to the amount specified above. If your modified adjusted gross income is 
more than $100,000 (more than $50,000 if married filing separately), your special allowance is limited 
to 50% of the difference between $150,000 ($75,000 if married filing separately) and your modified 
adjusted gross income.
Generally, if your modified adjusted gross income is $150,000 or more ($75,000 or more if you are 
married filing separately), there is no special allowance.

CHAPTER 9: SOLUTIONS AND SUGGESTED RESPONSES
Below are the solutions and suggested responses for the questions on the previous page(s). If you 
choose an incorrect answer, you should review the pages as indicated for each question to ensure 
comprehension of the material.
1.A. Incorrect.  Include  advanced  rent  in  your  rental  income  in  the  year  you  receive  it  
regardless of the period covered or the method of accounting used.
B. CORRECT.  If  you  plan  to  return  a  security  deposit  to  your  tenant  at  the  end  of  the  
lease, do not include it in your income when you receive it. If you keep part or all of the 
security deposit, include the amount you keep in your income for that year.
C. Incorrect. If your tenant pays you to cancel a lease, the amount you receive is considered 
rent.  Include  the  payment  in  your  income  in  the  year  you  receive  it  regardless  of  the  
method of accounting used.
D. Incorrect. If your tenant pays any of your expenses, the payments are rental  income  
and you must include them in your income. You can deduct the expenses if they are 
deductible rental expenses.
(See pages 69 to 70 of the course material.)
2.A. Incorrect. Generally, you cannot deduct charges for local benefits that increase the 
value of your property. You must add them to the basis of your property.
B. Incorrect.  You  cannot  deduct  the  cost  of  improvements.  You  can  recover  the  cost  of  
improvements, however, by taking depreciation.
C. Incorrect. If you are a cash basis taxpayer, you do not report uncollected rent because 
you do not include it in your income.
D. CORRECT. You can deduct the cost of repairs to your rental property. A repair keeps 
your property in good operating condition, but it does not materially add to the value of 
your property or substantially prolong its life.
(See pages 71 to 73 of the course material.)
3.A. Incorrect. A rental property can be used as a home by the owner for more than 10 days 
during a tax year, even if rented for 100 days.
B. CORRECT. The maximum number of days a rental property can be used as a home 
and still retain its classification is the greater of 14 days or 10% of the total days it is 
rented to others at a fair market price. In this scenario, 14 days is the maximum.
C. Incorrect. A period of 21 days will result in the loss of rental property status.
D. Incorrect.  A  period  of  30  days  is  too  long  and  will  result  in  the  loss  of  rental  property  
status.
(See page 74 of the course material.)

 94  •  Chapter 9: Rental Income and Expenses
4.A. Incorrect. Your cost basis in the property is one of the three factors that determine how 
much depreciation you can deduct.
B. Incorrect. The recovery period for the property is one of the three factors that determine 
how much depreciation you can deduct.
C. Incorrect. The depreciation method used is one of the three factors that determine how 
much depreciation you can deduct.
D. CORRECT. The age of the property is not a factor in the determination of how much 
depreciation you can deduct.

After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• Identify various requirements regarding retirement plan taxation.
I.   WHAT’S NEW
SECURE ACT AND SECURE ACT 2.0
The SECURE Act, signed into law on December 20, 2019, made the following changes for tax years after 
2019: moved the start date for required minimum distributions (RMDs) to the year in which the owner 
turns 72; ended the 70½ age limit for contributions to a traditional IRA; and shortened the distribution 
period for non-spouse inherited IRAs to a 10-year maximum.
Subsequently, the SECURE Act 2.0, signed into law on December 29, 2022, further changed the RMD 
start date to the year in which the owner turns 73, if not 72 prior to January 1, 2023. The SECURE Act 
2.0 also decreased the penalty for not taking an RMD from 50% to 25% of the RMD amount, and 10% if 
corrected timely.
TRADITIONAL IRA AND ROTH IRA CONTRIBUTION PHASEOUT
For 2024, the contribution limit for traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs is $7,000, or $8,000 for those age 50 
or older.
The deduction limit for 2024 contributions to a traditional IRA is phased out for active plan participants 
with modified AGI (MAGI) of over $77,000 and under $87,000 for a single person or head of household, 
or over $123,000 and under $143,000 for married persons filing jointly. The phaseout range is MAGI 
over $230,000 and under $240,000 for a spouse who is not an active plan participant and files jointly 
with a spouse who is an active plan participant.
The 2024 Roth IRA contribution limit is phased out for a single person or head of household with MAGI 
over $146,000 and under $161,000, and for married persons filing jointly with MAGI over $230,000 and 
under $240,000.
401K
The elective deferral limit for employees who participate in 401(k), 403(b), or 457(b) plans is $23,000 in 
2024. The catch-up contribution is $7,500 for those age 50 and over for 2024.

II. INTRODUCTION 
This chapter discusses the tax treatment of distributions you receive from: 
1. An employee pension or annuity from a qualified plan, 
2. A disability retirement, and 
3. A purchased commercial annuity. 
What is not covered in this chapter. The following topics are not discussed in this chapter: 
1. The General Rule. This is the method generally used to determine the tax treatment of 
pension and annuity income from nonqualified plans (including commercial annuities). 
If your annuity starting date is after November 18, 1996, you generally cannot use the 
General Rule for a qualified plan. 
2. Individual  retirement  arrangements  (IRAs).  Information  on  the  tax  treatment  of  
amounts you receive from an IRA is in chapter 17. 
III. GENER AL INFORMATION 
Designated Roth accounts. A designated Roth account is a separate account created under a qualified 
Roth contribution program to which participants may elect to have part or all of their elective deferrals to 
a 401(k), 403(b), or 457(b) plan designated as Roth contributions. Elective deferrals that are designated 
as Roth contributions are included in your income. However, qualified distributions are not included in 
your income.
More than one program. If you receive benefits from more than one program under a single trust or 
plan of your employer, such as a pension plan and a profit-sharing plan, you may have to figure the 
taxable part of each separately. Your former employer or the plan administrator should be able to tell you 
if you have more than one pension or annuity contract.
Section  457  deferred  compensation  plans. If you work for a state or local government or for a tax-
exempt organization, you may be able to participate in a section 457 deferred compensation plan. If 
your plan is an eligible plan, you are not taxed currently on pay that is deferred under the plan or on 
any earnings from the plan’s investment of the deferred pay. You are taxed on amounts deferred in an 
eligible state or local government plan only when they are distributed from the plan. You are taxed on 
amounts deferred in an eligible tax-exempt organization plan when they are distributed or otherwise 
made available to you.
Your 457(b) plan may have a designated Roth account option. If so, you may be able to roll over amounts 
to the designated Roth account or make contributions. Elective deferrals to a designated Roth account 
are included in your income. Qualified distributions from a designated Roth account are not subject to 
tax.

 97  •  Chapter 10: Retirement Plans, Pensions, and Annuities
Disability pensions. If you retired on disability, you generally must include in income any disability 
pension  you  receive  under  a  plan  that  is  paid  for  by  your  employer.  You  must  report  your  taxable 
disability payments as wages on line 1a of Form 1040 or 1040-SR until you reach minimum retirement 
age. Minimum retirement age generally is the age at which you can first receive a pension or annuity if 
you are not disabled.
Tip
 
You may be entitled to a tax credit if you were permanently and totally disabled when 
you retired. For information on this credit, see chapter 32.
Beginning on the day after you reach minimum retirement age, payments you receive are taxable as a 
pension or annuity. Report the payments on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, lines 5a and 5b.
Tip
 
Disability payments for injuries incurred as a direct result of a terrorist attack directed 
against the United States (or its allies) are not included in income.
For more information on how to report disability pensions, including military and 
certain government disability pensions, see chapter 5.
Railroad retirement benefits. Part  of  the  railroad retirement benefits you receive is treated for tax 
purposes like social security benefits, and part is treated like an employee pension. 
Withholding  and  estimated  tax. The payer of your pension, profit-sharing, stock bonus, annuity, or 
deferred compensation plan will withhold income tax on the taxable parts of amounts paid to you. You 
can tell the payer how much to withhold, or not to withhold, by filing Form W-4P. If you choose not to 
have tax withheld, or you do not have enough tax withheld, you may have to pay estimated tax.
If you receive an eligible rollover distribution, you cannot choose not to have tax withheld. Generally, 
20% will be withheld, but no tax will be withheld on a direct rollover of an eligible rollover distribution. 
See Direct rollover option under Rollovers, later. 
Loans.  If  you  borrow  money  from  your  retirement  plan,  you  must  treat  the  loan  as  a  nonperiodic 
distribution from the plan unless certain exceptions apply. This treatment also applies to any loan under 
a contract purchased under your retirement plan, and to the value of any part of your interest in the 
plan or contract that you pledge or assign. This means that you must include in income all or part of the 
amount borrowed. Even if you do not have to treat the loan as a nonperiodic distribution, you may not be 
able to deduct the interest on the loan in some situations.

 98  •  Chapter 10: Retirement Plans, Pensions, and Annuities
Qualified plans for self-employed individuals. Qualified plans set up by self-employed individuals are 
sometimes called Keogh or H.R. 10 plans. Qualified plans can be set up by sole proprietors, partnerships 
(but not a partner), and corporations. They can cover self-employed persons, such as the sole proprietor 
or partners, as well as regular (common-law) employees. 
Distributions from a qualified plan are usually fully taxable because most recipients have no cost basis. 
If you have an investment (cost) in the plan, however, your pension or annuity payments from a qualified 
plan are taxed under the Simplified Method. 
Purchased annuities. If you receive pension or annuity payments from a privately purchased annuity 
contract from a commercial organization, such as an insurance company, you generally must use the 
General Rule to figure the tax-free part of each annuity payment. 
Tax-free  exchange.  No  gain  or  loss  is  recognized  on  an  exchange  of  an  annuity  contract  for  another  
annuity  contract  if  the  insured  or  annuitant  remains  the  same.  However,  if  an  annuity  contract  is 
exchanged for a life insurance or endowment contract, any gain due to interest accumulated on the 
contract is ordinary income. 
I V.  COST (INVESTMENT IN THE CONTRACT) 
Before you can figure how much, if any, of your pension or annuity benefits is taxable, you must determine 
your cost (your investment in the contract) in the pension or annuity. Your total cost in the plan includes 
the total premiums, contributions, or other amounts that you paid. It also includes amounts that were 
taxable to you when paid. Cost does not include any amounts you deducted or excluded from income. 
From this total cost paid or considered paid by you, subtract any refunds of premiums, rebates, dividends, 
unrepaid loans, or other tax-free amounts you received by the later of the annuity starting date or the 
date on which you received your first payment. 
Your annuity starting date is the later of the first day of the first period for which you received a payment, 
or the date the plan’s obligations became fixed. 
Designated  Roth  accounts. Your cost in these accounts is your designated Roth contributions that 
were included in your income as wages subject to applicable withholding requirements. Your cost will 
also include any in-plan Roth rollovers you included in income.
Foreign employment contributions. If you worked in a foreign country and your employer contributed 
to your retirement plan, special rules apply in determining your cost. 
V.   TAX ATION OF PERIODIC PAYMENTS
Fully taxable payments. Generally, if you did not pay any part of the cost of your employee pension or 
annuity and your employer did not withhold part of the cost from your pay while you worked, the amounts 
you receive each year are fully taxable. You must report them on your income tax return.

 99  •  Chapter 10: Retirement Plans, Pensions, and Annuities
Partly taxable payments. If you paid part of the cost of your annuity, you are not taxed on the part of the 
annuity you receive that represents a return of your cost. The rest of the amount you receive is generally 
taxable. You figure the tax-free part of the payment using either the Simplified Method or the General 
Rule. Your annuity starting date and whether or not your plan is qualified determine which method you 
must or may use.
If the annuity starting date is after November 18, 1996, and your payments are from a qualified plan, you 
must use the Simplified Method. Generally, you must use the General Rule if your annuity is paid under 
a nonqualified plan, and you cannot use this method if your annuity is paid under a qualified plan.
If you had more than one partly taxable pension or annuity, figure the tax-free part and the taxable part 
of each separately.
If your annuity is paid under a qualified plan and your annuity starting date is after July 1, 1986, and 
before November 19, 1996, you could have chosen to use either the General Rule or the Simplified 
Method.
Exclusion limit. Your annuity starting date determines the total amount that you can exclude from your 
taxable income over the years. Once your annuity starting date is determined, it does not change. If 
you calculate the taxable portion of your annuity payments using the Simplified Method Worksheet, the 
annuity starting date determines the recovery period for your cost. That recovery period begins on your 
annuity starting date and is not affected by the date you first complete the worksheet.
Exclusion limited to cost. If your annuity starting date is after 1986, the total amount of annuity income 
that you can exclude over the years as a recovery of the cost cannot exceed your total cost. 
Exclusion  not  limited  to  cost. If your annuity starting date is before 1987, you can continue to take 
your monthly exclusion for as long as you receive your annuity. If you chose a joint and survivor annuity, 
your survivor can continue to take the survivor’s exclusion figured as of the annuity starting date. The 
total exclusion may be more than your cost. 
SIMPLIFIED METHOD 
Under the Simplified Method, you figure the tax-free part of each monthly annuity payment by dividing 
your cost by the total number of expected monthly payments. For an annuity that is payable for the 
lives of the annuitants, this number is based on the annuitants’ ages on the annuity starting date and is 
determined from a table. For any other annuity, this number is the number of monthly annuity payments 
under the contract. 
Who must use the Simplified Method. You must use the Simplified Method if your annuity starting date 
is after November 18, 1996, and you receive pension or annuity payments from a qualified employee 
plan, qualified employee annuity, or a tax-sheltered annuity (403(b)) plan, and on your annuity starting 
date, you were either under age 75, or entitled to less than 5 years of guaranteed payments.
Guaranteed payments. Your annuity contract provides guaranteed payments if a minimum number of 
payments or a minimum amount (for example, the amount of your investment) is payable even if you 

 100  •  Chapter 10: Retirement Plans, Pensions, and Annuities
and any survivor annuitant do not live to receive the minimum. If the minimum amount is less than the 
total amount of the payments you are to receive, barring death, during the first 5 years after payments 
begin (figured by ignoring any payment increases), you are entitled to less than 5 years of guaranteed 
payments. 
Example
Bill Smith, age 65, began receiving retirement benefits in 2024, under a joint and 
survivor annuity. Bill’s annuity starting date is January 1, 2024. The benefits are to be 
paid for the joint lives of Bill and his wife Kathy, age 65. Bill had contributed $31,000 to 
a qualified plan and had received no distributions before the annuity starting date. Bill 
is to receive a retirement benefit of $1,200 a month, and Kathy is to receive a monthly 
survivor benefit of $600 upon Bill’s death.
Bill must use the Simplified Method to figure his taxable annuity because his payments 
are from a qualified plan and he is under age 75. Because his annuity is payable over the 
lives of more than one annuitant, he uses his and Kathy’s combined ages (and Table 2 at 
the bottom of the worksheet) in completing line 3 of the Simplified Method Worksheet. 
Bill’s tax-free monthly amount is $100 ($31,000 / 310) as shown on line 4 of the 
worksheet. Upon Bill’s death, if Bill has not recovered the full $31,000 investment, 
Kathy will also exclude $100 from her $600 monthly payment. The full amount of 
any annuity payments received after 310 payments are paid must be included in gross 
income.
Who  must  use  the  General  Rule.  You  must  use  the  General  Rule  if  you  receive  pension  or  annuity  
payments from: 
1. A nonqualified plan (such as a private annuity, a purchased commercial annuity, or a 
nonqualified employee plan), or 
2. A qualified plan if you are age 75 or older on your annuity starting date and your annuity 
payments are guaranteed for at least 5 years. 
Who cannot use the General Rule. You cannot use the General Rule if you receive your pension or 
annuity from a qualified plan and none of the circumstances described in the preceding discussions 
apply to you. See Who must use the Simplified Method, earlier. 
VI. TAXATION OF NONPERIODIC PAYMENTS
Nonperiodic  distributions  are  also  known  as  amounts  not  received  as  an  annuity.  They  include  all 
payments other than periodic payments and corrective distributions.
Corrective  distributions  of  excess  plan  contributions. Generally, if the contributions made for you 
during the year to certain retirement plans exceed certain limits, the excess is taxable to you. To correct 
any excess, your plan may distribute it to you (along with any income earned on the excess).

 101  •  Chapter 10: Retirement Plans, Pensions, and Annuities
Figuring  the  taxable  amount  of  nonperiodic  payments.  How you figure the taxable amount of a 
nonperiodic distribution depends on whether it is made before the annuity starting date or on or after 
the annuity starting date. If it is made before the annuity starting date, its tax treatment also depends on 
whether it is made under a qualified or nonqualified plan. If it is made under a nonqualified plan, its tax 
treatment depends on whether it fully discharges the contract or is allocable to an investment you made 
before August 14, 1982.
Distribution on or after annuity starting date. If you receive a nonperiodic payment from your annuity 
contract on or after the annuity starting date, you generally must include all of the payment in gross 
income.
Distribution before annuity starting date. If you receive a nonperiodic distribution before the annuity 
starting date from a qualified retirement plan, you generally can allocate only part of it to the cost of the 
contract.  You  exclude  from  your  gross  income  the  part  that  you  allocate  to  the  cost.  You  include  the  
remainder in your gross income.
If you receive a nonperiodic distribution before the annuity starting date from a plan other than a qualified 
retirement plan, it is generally allocated first to earnings (the taxable part) and then to the cost of the 
contract (the tax-free part). This allocation rule applies, for example, to a commercial annuity contract 
you bought directly from the issuer.
Caution!
 
Distributions from nonqualified plans are subject to the NIIT. See the Instructions for 
Form 8960.
LUMP-SUM DISTRIBUTIONS  
Lump-sum distribution defined. A lump-sum distribution is the distribution or payment in 1 tax year 
of a plan participant’s entire balance from all of the employer’s qualified plans of one kind (for example, 
pension,  profit-sharing,  or  stock  bonus  plans).  A  distribution  from  a  nonqualified  plan  (such  as  a 
privately purchased commercial annuity or a section 457 deferred compensation plan of a state or local 
government or tax-exempt organization) cannot qualify as a lump-sum distribution. 
The participant’s entire balance from a plan does not include certain forfeited amounts. It also does not 
include any deductible voluntary employee contributions allowed by the plan after 1981 and before 1987.
If you receive a lump-sum distribution from a qualified employee plan or qualified employee annuity 
and the plan participant was born before January 2, 1936, you may be able to elect optional methods 
of figuring the tax on the distribution. The part from active participation in the plan before 1974 may 
qualify as capital gain subject to a 20% tax rate. The part from participation after 1973 (and any part from 
participation before 1974 that you do not report as capital gain) is ordinary income. You may be able to 
use the 10-year tax option, discussed later, to figure tax on the ordinary income part. 

 102  •  Chapter 10: Retirement Plans, Pensions, and Annuities
Use Form 4972 to figure the separate tax on a lump-sum distribution using the optional methods. The 
tax figured on Form 4972 is added to the regular tax figured on your other income. This may result in a 
smaller tax than you would pay by including the taxable amount of the distribution as ordinary income in 
figuring your regular tax. 
How  to  treat  the  distribution.  If  you  receive  a  lump-sum  distribution,  you  may  have  the  following 
options for how you treat the taxable part.
• Report the part of the distribution from participation before 1974 as a capital gain (if you 
qualify) and the part from participation after 1973 as ordinary income.
• Report the part of the distribution from participation before 1974 as a capital gain (if you 
qualify) and use the 10-year tax option to figure the tax on the part from participation after 
1973 (if you qualify). 
• Use the 10-year tax option to figure the tax on the total taxable amount (if you qualify). 
• Roll over all or part of the distribution. See Rollovers, later. No tax is currently due on the 
part rolled over. Report any part not rolled over as ordinary income. 
• Report the entire taxable part of the distribution as ordinary income on your tax return. 
The first three options are explained in the following discussions. 
Electing optional lump-sum treatment. You can choose to use the 10-year tax option or capital gain 
treatment only once after 1986 for any plan participant. If you make this choice, you cannot use either of 
these optional treatments for any future distributions for the participant. 
Taxable  and  tax-free  parts  of  the  distribution.  The taxable part of a lump-sum distribution is the 
employer’s contributions and income earned on your account. You may recover your cost in the lump 
sum and any net unrealized appreciation (NUA) in employer securities tax free. 
Cost. In general, your cost is the total of: 
1. The plan participant’s nondeductible contributions to the plan, 
2. The plan participant’s taxable costs of any life insurance contract distributed, 
3. Any employer contributions that were taxable to the plan participant, and 
4. Repayments of any loans that were taxable to the plan participant. 
You must reduce this cost by amounts previously distributed tax free. 
Capital Gain Treatment 
Capital  gain  treatment  applies  only  to  the  taxable  part  of  a  lump-sum  distribution  resulting  from 
participation in the plan before 1974. The amount treated as capital gain is taxed at a 20% rate. You can 
elect this treatment only once for any plan participant, and only if the plan participant was born before 
January 2, 1936. Complete Part II of Form 4972 to choose the 20% capital gain election.

 103  •  Chapter 10: Retirement Plans, Pensions, and Annuities
10-Year Tax Option 
The 10-year tax option is a special formula used to figure a separate tax on the ordinary income part of 
a lump-sum distribution. You pay the tax only once, for the year in which you receive the distribution, not 
over the next 10 years. You can elect this treatment only once for any plan participant, and only if the 
plan participant was born before January 2, 1936. 
The ordinary income part of the distribution is the amount shown in box 2a of the Form 1099-R given to 
you by the payer, minus the amount, if any, shown in box 3. You also can treat the capital gain part of the 
distribution (box 3 of Form 1099-R) as ordinary income for the 10-year tax option if you do not choose 
capital gain treatment for that part. 
Complete Part III of Form 4972 to choose the 10-year tax option. You must use the Special Tax Rates 
Schedule shown in the instructions for Part III to figure the tax. 
VII. ROLLOVERS
If you withdraw cash or other assets from a qualified retirement plan in an eligible rollover distribution, 
you can defer tax on the distribution by rolling it over to another qualified retirement plan or a traditional 
IRA, or, after 2 years of participation in a SIMPLE IRA plan sponsored by your employer, a SIMPLE IRA 
under that plan. 
For this purpose, the following plans are qualified retirement plans. 
• A qualified employee plan. 
• A qualified employee annuity. 
• A tax sheltered annuity plan (403(b) plan). 
• An eligible state or local government section 457 deferred compensation plan. 
Rollovers to SIMPLE retirement accounts. You can roll over amounts from a qualified retirement plan 
(as described next) or an IRA into a SIMPLE retirement account as follows.
1. During the first 2 years of participation in a SIMPLE retirement account, you may roll over 
amounts from one SIMPLE retirement account into another SIMPLE retirement account.
2. After 2 years of participation in a SIMPLE retirement account, you may roll over amounts 
from a SIMPLE retirement, a qualified retirement plan, or an IRA into a SIMPLE retirement 
account.
Eligible rollover distributions. Generally, an eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any 
part of the balance to your credit in a qualified retirement plan. 
Rollover of nontaxable amounts. You may be able to roll over the nontaxable part of a distribution (such 
as your after-tax contributions) made to another qualified retirement plan that is a qualified employee 
plan or a 403(b) plan, or to a traditional or Roth IRA. The transfer must be made either through a direct 

 104  •  Chapter 10: Retirement Plans, Pensions, and Annuities
rollover to a qualified plan or 403(b) that separately accounts for the taxable and nontaxable parts of the 
rollover or through a rollover to a traditional or Roth IRA. 
If you roll over only part of a distribution that includes both taxable and nontaxable amounts, the amount 
you roll over is treated as coming first from the taxable part of the distribution.
Any after-tax contributions that you roll over into your traditional IRA become part of your basis (cost) in 
your IRAs. To recover your basis when you take distributions from your IRA, you must complete Form 
8606 for the year of the distribution.
Direct  rollover  option. You can choose to have any part or all of an eligible rollover distribution paid 
directly to another qualified retirement plan that accepts rollover distributions or to a traditional or Roth 
IRA. If you choose the direct rollover option, or have an automatic rollover, no tax will be withheld from 
any part of the distribution that is directly paid to the trustee of the other plan. 
Payment to you option. If an eligible rollover distribution is paid to you, 20% generally will be withheld 
for income tax. However, the full amount is treated as distributed to you even though you actually receive 
only 80%. You generally must include in income any part (including the part withheld) that you do not 
rollover within 60 days to another qualified retirement plan or to a traditional or Roth IRA.
If you are under age 59½ when a distribution is paid to you, you may have to pay a 10% tax (in addition 
to the regular income tax) on the taxable part (including any tax withheld) that you do not roll over. 
Caution!
If you decide to roll over an amount equal to the distribution before withholding, your 
contribution to the new plan or IRA must include other money (for example, from 
savings or amounts borrowed) to replace the amount withheld.
Time  for  making  rollover. You generally must complete the rollover of an eligible distribution paid to 
you by the 60th day following the day on which you receive the distribution from your employer’s plan. (If 
an amount distributed to you becomes a frozen deposit in a financial institution during the 60-day period 
after you receive it, the rollover period is extended for the period during which the distribution is in a 
frozen deposit in a financial institution.)
The administrator of a qualified plan must give you a written explanation of your distribution options 
within a reasonable period of time before making an eligible rollover distribution. 
Tip
The IRS may waive the 60-day requirement where the failure to do so would be against 
equity or good conscience, such as in the event of a casualty, disaster, or other event 
beyond your reasonable control.

 105  •  Chapter 10: Retirement Plans, Pensions, and Annuities
Qualified domestic relations order. You may be able to roll over all or any part of a distribution from 
a qualified retirement plan that you receive under a qualified domestic relations order (QDRO). If you 
receive the distribution as an employee’s spouse or former spouse (not as a nonspousal beneficiary), 
the rollover rules apply to you as if you were the employee. You can roll over the distribution from the 
plan into a traditional IRA or to another eligible retirement plan.
Rollover by surviving spouse. You may be able to roll over tax free all or part of a distribution from a 
qualified retirement plan you receive as the surviving spouse of a deceased employee. The rollover rules 
apply to you as if you were the employee. You can roll over a distribution into a qualified retirement plan 
or a traditional IRA or Roth IRA.
A distribution paid to a beneficiary other than the employee’s surviving spouse is generally not an eligible 
rollover distribution. However, see Rollovers by nonspouse beneficiary, next. 
Rollovers by nonspouse beneficiary.  If  you  are  a  designated  beneficiary  (other  than  a  surviving 
spouse) of a deceased employee, you may be able to roll over tax free all or a portion of a distribution 
you receive from an eligible retirement plan of a deceased employee. The distribution must be a direct 
trustee-to-trustee transfer to your traditional or Roth IRA that was set up to receive the distribution. The 
transfer will be treated as an eligible rollover distribution and the receiving plan will be treated as an 
inherited IRA.
Designated Roth accounts. You can roll over an eligible distribution from a designated Roth account 
only into another designated Roth account or a Roth IRA. If you want to roll over the part of the distribution 
that is not included in income, you must make a direct rollover of the entire distribution or you can roll 
over the entire amount (or any portion) to a Roth IRA.
In-plan rollovers to designated Roth accounts. If you are a participant in a 401(k), 403(b), or 457(b) 
plan, your plan may permit you to roll over amounts in those plans to a designated Roth account within 
the same plan. The rollover of any untaxed money must be included in income in the year you receive 
the distribution. 
Rollovers to Roth IRAs. You can roll over distributions directly from a qualified retirement plan (other 
than a designated Roth account) to a Roth IRA.
You  must  include  in  your  gross  income  distributions  from  a  qualified  retirement  plan  (other  than  a 
designated Roth account) that you would have had to include in income if you had not rolled them over 
into a Roth IRA. You do not include in gross income any part of a distribution from a qualified retirement 
plan that is a return of contributions to the plan that were taxable to you when paid. In addition, the 10% 
tax on early distributions does not apply.
VIII. SPECIAL ADDITIONAL TAXES 
To discourage the use of pension funds for purposes other than normal retirement, the law imposes 
additional  taxes  on  early  distributions  of  those  funds  and  on  failures  to  withdraw  the  funds  timely. 
Ordinarily, you will not be subject to these taxes if you roll over all early distributions you receive, as 
explained earlier, and begin drawing out the funds at a normal retirement age, in reasonable amounts 
over your life expectancy. These special additional taxes are the taxes on: 

 106  •  Chapter 10: Retirement Plans, Pensions, and Annuities
• Early distributions, and 
• Excess accumulation (not receiving minimum distributions). 
These taxes are discussed in the following sections. 
If you must pay either of these taxes, report them on Form 5329. However, you do not have to file Form 
5329 if you owe only the tax on early distributions and your Form 1099-R shows a “1” in box 7. Instead, 
enter 10% of the taxable part of the distribution on Schedule 2 (Form 1040), line 8. Also, check the box 
on line 8 to indicate that you do not have to file Form 5329. 
Even if you do not owe any of these taxes, you may have to complete Form 5329 and attach it to your 
Form 1040 or 1040-SR. This applies if you meet an exception to the tax on early distributions but box 7 
of your Form 1099-R does not indicate an exception.
Tax on Early Distributions  
Most  distributions  (both  periodic  and  nonperiodic)  from  qualified  retirement  plans  and  nonqualified 
annuity contracts made to you before you reach age 59½ are subject to an additional tax of 10%. This 
tax applies to the part of the distribution that you must include in gross income. 
For this purpose, a qualified retirement plan is: 
• A qualified employee plan, 
• A qualified employee annuity plan, 
• A tax-sheltered annuity plan, or 
• An eligible state or local government section 457 deferred compensation plan (to the 
extent that any distribution is attributable to amounts the plan received in a direct transfer 
or rollover from one of the other plans listed here or on IRA). 
5% rate on certain early distributions from deferred annuity contracts. If an early withdrawal from a 
deferred annuity is otherwise subject to the 10% additional tax, a 5% rate may apply instead. A 5% rate 
applies to distributions under a written election providing a specific schedule for the distribution of your 
interest in the contract if, as of March 1, 1986, you had begun receiving payments under the election. 
On line 4 of Form 5329, multiply the line 3 amount by 5% instead of 10%. Attach an explanation to your 
return. 
Exceptions to tax. Certain early distributions are excepted from the early distribution tax. If the payer 
knows that an exception applies to your early distribution, distribution code “2,” “3,” or “4” should be 
shown in box 7 of your Form 1099-R and you do not have to report the distribution on Form 5329. If an 
exception applies but distribution code “1” (early distribution, no known exception) is shown in box 7, you 
must file Form 5329. Enter the taxable amount of the distribution shown in box 2a of your Form 1099-
R on line 1 of Form 5329. On line 2, enter the amount that can be excluded and the exception number 
shown in the Form 5329 instructions. 

 107  •  Chapter 10: Retirement Plans, Pensions, and Annuities
General exceptions. The tax does not apply to distributions that are: 
• Made as part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (made at least annually) 
for your life (or life expectancy) or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of you and your 
designated beneficiary (if from a qualified retirement plan, the payments must begin after 
your separation from service), 
• Made because you are totally and permanently disabled,
• Made to you because you have received a certification that you are terminally ill, or 
• Made on or after the death of the plan participant or contract holder. 
Additional exceptions for qualified retirement plans. The tax does not apply to distributions that are: 
• From a qualified retirement plan (other than an IRA) after your separation from service in 
or after the year you reached age 55 (the earlier of age 50 or 25 years of service under 
the plan for qualified public safety employees),
• From a qualified retirement plan (other than an IRA) after your separation from service in 
or after the year you reached the earlier of age 50 or 25 years of service under the plan, if 
you are a private sector firefighter.
• From  a  qualified  retirement  plan  (other  than  an  IRA)  to  an  alternate  payee  under  a 
qualified domestic relations order,
• From a qualified retirement plan to the extent you have deductible medical expenses that 
exceed 7.5% of your adjusted gross income, whether or not you itemize your deductions 
for the year,
• From an employer plan under a written election that provides a specific schedule for 
distribution of your entire interest if, as of March 1, 1986, you had separated from service 
and had begun receiving payments under the election, 
• From an employee stock ownership plan for dividends on employer securities held by the 
plan, 
• From a qualified retirement plan due to an IRS levy of the plan, 
• From elective deferral accounts under 401(k) or 403(b) plans or similar arrangements 
that are qualified reservist distributions, 
• Phased retirement annuity payments made to federal employees, or
• From a qualified retirement plan (other than an IRA) for a qualified birth or adoption.
Qualified reservist distributions. A qualified reservist distribution is not subject to the additional tax on 
early distributions. A qualified reservist distribution is a distribution: (a) from elective deferrals under a 
section 401(k) or 403(b) plan or similar arrangement, (b) to an individual ordered or called to active duty 

 108  •  Chapter 10: Retirement Plans, Pensions, and Annuities
(because he or she is a member of a reserve component) for a period of more than 179 days or for an 
indefinite period, and (c) made during the period beginning on the date of the order or call and ending 
at the close of the active duty period. You must be ordered or called to active duty after September 11, 
2001.
Tax on Excess Accumulation 
To make sure that most of your retirement benefits are paid to you during your lifetime, rather than to 
your beneficiaries after your death, the payments that you receive from qualified retirement plans must 
begin no later than on your required beginning date (defined later). The payments each year cannot be 
less than the required minimum distribution.
Required  distributions  not  made.  If  the  actual  distributions  to  you  in  any  year  are  less  than  the 
minimum required distribution for that year, you are subject to an additional tax. The tax equals 25% of 
the part of the required minimum distribution that was not distributed.
Note
A provision in the SECURE Act 2.0 reduced the amount of this additional tax in 2023 
and after from 50% to 25%, and possibly to 10% if the RMD is timely corrected within 
2 years.
For this purpose, a qualified retirement plan includes a: 
1. Qualified employee plan, 
2. Qualified employee annuity plan, 
3. An eligible section 457 deferred compensation plan, or 
4. Tax-sheltered annuity plan (403(b) plan) (for benefits accruing after 1986). 
Required beginning date. Unless the rule for 5% owners applies, you generally must begin to receive 
distributions from your qualified retirement plan by April 1 of the year that follows the later of: 
1. The calendar year in which you reach age 72, (73 if you are not 72 before January 1, 
2023), or 
2. The calendar year in which you retire from employment with the employer maintaining the 
plan.
However, your plan may require you to begin to receive distributions by April 1 of the year that follows 
the year in which you reach age 72 (73 if applicable) even if you have not retired.
If you reached age 72 in 2022, you may be required to receive your first distribution by April 1, 2023. 
Your required distribution then must be made for 2023 by December 31, 2023. If you reach age 73 in 

 109  •  Chapter 10: Retirement Plans, Pensions, and Annuities
2024, you may be required to receive your first distribution by April 1, 2025. Your required distribution for 
2025 then must be made by December 31, 2025.
5% owners. If you are a 5% owner of the company maintaining your qualified retirement plan, you must 
begin to receive distributions by April 1 of the calendar year that follows the year in which you reach age 
72 (73 if applicable).
You are a 5% owner if, for the plan year ending in the calendar year in which you reach age 72 (73 if 
applicable), you own (or are considered to own under section 318 of the Internal Revenue Code) more 
than 5% of the outstanding stock (or more than 5% of the total voting power of all stock) of the employer, 
or more than 5% of the capital or profits interest in the employer.
Required distributions. By the required beginning date, as explained above, you must either: 
• Receive your entire interest in the plan (for a tax-sheltered annuity, your entire benefit 
accruing after 1986), or
• Begin  receiving  periodic  distributions  in  annual  amounts  calculated  to  distribute  your 
entire interest (for a tax-sheltered annuity, your entire benefit accruing after 1986) over 
your  life  or  life  expectancy  or  over  the  joint  lives  or  joint  life  expectancies  of  you  and  a  
designated beneficiary (or over a shorter period). 
Form 5329. You must file a Form 5329 if you owe a tax because you did not receive a minimum required 
distribution from your qualified retirement plan.

CHAPTER 10: SOLUTION AND SUGGESTED RESPONSES
Below  is  the  solution  and  suggested  responses  for  the  question  on  the  previous  page.  If  you 
choose an incorrect answer, you should review the page(s) as indicated for the question to ensure 
comprehension of the material.
1.A. Incorrect. A sum is withheld for income tax, but it is greater than 10%.
B. CORRECT.  The  sum  withheld  for  income  tax  is  20%,  not  10%.  Even  though  the 
individual actually receives only 80%, the full amount is treated as distributed, and the 
individual must include in income any part (including the part withheld) that he or she 
does not rollover within 60 days to another qualified retirement plan or to a traditional 
or Roth IRA.
(See page 106 of the course material.)
2.A. Incorrect. Avoiding an early distribution tax at age 50 is not generally available. However 
certain qualified public safety employees, after a separation in service, may qualify. 
B. Incorrect. An exception rule for distributions at age 55 after separation from service 
can apply to payments made from a qualified retirement plan, but this is not the age in 
general.
C. CORRECT. Early distribution taxes no longer apply to individuals receiving qualified 
retirement plan payments upon reaching the age of 59½.
D. Incorrect. Age 65 has no significance with regard to determining an early distribution 
tax liability.

CHAPTER 11: SOCIAL SECURITY AND EQUIVALENT 
RAILROAD RETIREMENT BENEFITS
Chapter Objective
After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• Recognize key taxation thresholds related to social security income.
I.   INTRODUCTION 
This  chapter  explains  the  federal  income  tax  rules  for  social  security  benefits  and  equivalent  tier  1 
railroad retirement benefits. It explains: 
• How to figure whether your benefits are taxable, 
• How to report your taxable benefits,
• How to use the social security benefits worksheet (with examples), and
• How to treat repayments that are more than the benefits you received during the year. 
Social security benefits include monthly survivor and disability benefits. They do not include supplemental 
security income (SSI) payments, which are not taxable.
Equivalent  tier  1  railroad retirement benefits are the part of tier 1 benefits that a railroad employee or 
beneficiary would have been entitled to receive under the social  security  system.  They  are  commonly  
called the social security equivalent benefit (SSEB) portion of tier 1 benefits.
If you received these benefits during 2024, you should receive a Form SSA-1099 or Form RRB-1099 
(Form SSA-1042S or Form RRB-1042S if you are a nonresident alien). These forms show the amounts 
received and repaid, and taxes withheld for the year. You may receive more than one of these forms for 
the same year. You should add the amounts shown on all Forms SSA-1099 and Forms RRB-1099 you 
receive for the year to determine the “total” amounts received and repaid, and taxes withheld for that 
year. 
Note
 
When the term “benefits” is used in this chapter, it applies to both social security 
benefits and the SSEB portion of tier 1 railroad retirement benefits.

 114  •  Chapter 11: Social Security and Equivalent Railroad Retirement Benefits
What is not covered in this chapter. This chapter does not cover the tax rules for the following railroad 
retirement benefits: 
• Non-social security equivalent benefit (NSSEB) portion of tier 1 benefits, 
• Tier 2 benefits, 
• Vested dual benefits, and 
• Supplemental annuity benefits.
II. ARE ANY OF YOUR BENEFITS TAXABLE? 
To find out whether any of your benefits are taxable, compare the base amount for your filing status with 
the total of:  
1. One-half of your benefits, plus 
2. All your other income, including tax-exempt interest.  
When making this comparison, do not reduce your other income by any exclusions for: 
• Interest from qualified U.S. savings bonds, 
• Employer-provided adoption benefits,
• Foreign earned income or foreign housing, or 
• Income earned by bona fide residents of American Samoa or Puerto Rico. 
Figuring  total  income.  To figure the total of one-half of your benefits plus your other income, use 
Worksheet 7-1 in IRS Publication 17. If the total is more than your base amount, part of your benefits 
may be taxable. 
If you are married and file a joint return for 2024, you and your spouse must combine your incomes and 
your benefits to figure whether any of your combined benefits are taxable. Even if your spouse did not 
receive any benefits, you must add your spouse’s income to yours to figure whether any of your benefits 
are taxable. 
Base amount. Your base amount is: 
• $25,000 if you are single, head of household, or qualifying surviving spouse, 
• $25,000 if you are married filing separately and lived apart from your spouse for all of 
2024, 
• $32,000 if you are married filing jointly, or 
• $-0- if you are married filing separately and lived with your spouse at any time during 
2024. 

 115  •  Chapter 11: Social Security and Equivalent Railroad Retirement Benefits
Tax  withholding  and  estimated  tax.  You  can  choose  to  have  federal  income  tax  withheld  from  your  
social security benefits and/or the SSEB portion of your tier 1 railroad retirement benefits. If you choose 
to do this, you must complete a Form W-4V. 
If you do not choose to have income tax withheld, you may have to request additional withholding from 
other income or pay estimated tax during the year. 
III. HOW TO REPORT YOUR BENEFITS 
If part of your benefits are taxable, you must use Form 1040 or 1040-SR. 
Reporting on Form 1040 or 1040-SR Report your net benefits (the amount in box 5 of your Forms SSA-
1099 or Form RRB-1099) on line 6a and the taxable part on line 6b. If you are married filing separately 
and you lived apart from your spouse for all of 2024, also enter “D” to the right of the word “benefits” on 
line 6a.
Benefits not taxable. Report your net benefits (the total amount from box 5 of all your Forms SSA-1099 
and Forms RRB-1099) on  Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 6a. Enter -0- on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 6b. 
If you are married filing separately and you lived apart from your spouse for all of 2024, also enter “D” to 
the right of the word “benefits” on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 6a. 
HOW MUCH IS TAXABLE? 
If part of your benefits are taxable, how much is taxable depends on the total amount of your benefits 
and other income. Generally, the higher that total amount, the greater the taxable part of your benefits. 
Maximum taxable part. Generally, up to 50% of your benefits will be taxable. However, up to 85% of 
your benefits can be taxable if either of the following situations applies to you.  
1. The total of one-half of your benefits and all your other income is more than $34,000 
($44,000 if you are married filing jointly). 
2. You are married filing separately and lived with your spouse at any time during 2024.  
Lump-sum election. You must include the taxable part of a lump-sum (retroactive) payment of benefits 
received in 2024 in your 2024 income, even if the payment includes benefits for an earlier year. 
Tip
This type of lump-sum benefit payment should not be confused with the lump-sum 
death benefit that both the SSA and RRB pay to many of their beneficiaries. No part of 
the lump-sum death benefit is subject to tax.

 116  •  Chapter 11: Social Security and Equivalent Railroad Retirement Benefits
Generally, you use your 2024 income to figure the taxable part of the total benefits received in 2024. 
However, you may be able to figure the taxable part of a lump-sum payment for an earlier year separately, 
using your income for the earlier year. You can elect this method if it lowers your taxable benefits. 
Making the election. If you received a lump-sum benefit payment in 2024 that includes benefits for one 
or more earlier years, follow the instructions in Publication 915 under Lump-Sum Election to see whether 
making the election will lower your taxable benefits. That discussion also explains how to make the 
election. 
Caution!
Because  the  earlier  year’s  taxable  benefits  are  included  in  your  2024  income,  no 
adjustment is made to the earlier year’s return. Do not file an amended return for the 
earlier year.

CHAPTER 12: OTHER INCOME
Chapter Objective
After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• Identify the taxability of various types of other income.
I.   REMINDER
Repeal  of  deduction  for  alimony  payments.  You  cannot  deduct  alimony  or  separate  maintenance  
payments  made  under  a  divorce  or  separation  agreement  (1)  executed  after  2018,  or  (2)  executed 
before 2019 but later modified if the modification expressly states the repeal of the deduction for alimony 
payments applies to the modification. Alimony and separate maintenance payments you receive under 
such an agreement are not included in your gross income.
II. INTRODUCTION 
This chapter discusses many kinds of income and explains whether they are taxable or nontaxable. 
• Income that is taxable must be reported on your tax return and is subject to tax. 
• Income that is nontaxable may have to be shown on your tax return but is not taxable. 
This chapter begins with discussions of the following income items. 
• Canceled debts.
• Life insurance proceeds. 
• Partnership income. 
• S Corporation income. 
• Recoveries (including state income tax refunds). 
• Rents from personal property. 
• Repayments. 
• Royalties. 
• Unemployment benefits. 
These discussions are followed by brief discussions of many income items arranged in alphabetical 
order.

 120  •  Chapter 12: Other Income
III. CANCELED DEBTS  
In most cases, if a debt you owe is canceled or forgiven, other than as a gift or bequest, you must 
include the canceled amount in your income. You have no income from the canceled debt if it is intended 
as a gift to you. A debt includes any indebtedness for which you are liable or which attaches to property 
you hold. 
If the debt is a nonbusiness debt, report the canceled amount on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8c. If it is 
a business debt, report the amount on Schedule C (Form 1040) (or on Schedule F, Profit or Loss From 
Farming (Form 1040), if the debt is farm debt and you are a farmer). 
Form 1099-C. If a federal government agency, financial institution, or credit union cancels or forgives a 
debt you owe of $600 or more, you will receive a Form 1099-C, Cancellation of Debt. The amount of the 
canceled debt is shown in box 2. 
Interest included in canceled debt. If any interest is forgiven and included in the amount of canceled 
debt in box 2, the amount of interest will also be shown in box 3. Whether or not you must include the 
interest portion of the canceled debt in your income depends on whether the interest would be deductible 
when you paid it. 
If the interest would not be deductible (such as interest on a personal loan), include in your income the 
amount from box 2 of Form 1099-C. If the interest would be deductible (such as on a business loan), 
include in your income the net amount of the canceled debt (the amount shown in box 2 less the interest 
amount shown in box 3). 
Discounted mortgage loan. If your financial institution offers a discount for the early payment of your 
mortgage loan, the amount of the discount is canceled debt. You must include the canceled amount in 
your income. 
Mortgage relief upon sale or other disposition. If you are personally liable for a mortgage (recourse 
debt), and you are relieved of the mortgage when you dispose of the property, you may realize gain or 
loss up to the fair market value of the property. To the extent the mortgage discharge exceeds the fair 
market value of the property, it is income from discharge of indebtedness unless it qualifies for exclusion 
under Exceptions, later. Report any income from discharge of indebtedness on nonbusiness debt that 
does not qualify for exclusion as other income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8c.
If you are not personally liable for a mortgage (nonrecourse debt), and you are relieved of the mortgage 
when  you  dispose  of  the  property  (such  as  through  foreclosure), that relief is included in the amount 
you realize. You may have a taxable gain if the amount you realize exceeds your adjusted basis in the 
property. Report any gain on nonbusiness property as a capital gain.

 121  •  Chapter 12: Other Income
Stockholder debt. If you are a stockholder in a corporation and the corporation cancels or forgives your 
debt to it, the canceled debt is a constructive distribution that is generally dividend income to you. 
If you are a stockholder in a corporation and you cancel a debt owed to you by the corporation, you 
generally do not realize income. This is because the canceled debt is considered as a contribution to the 
capital of the corporation equal to the amount of debt principal that you canceled. 
Repayment of canceled debt. If you included a canceled amount in your income and later pay the debt, 
you may be able to file a claim for refund for the year the amount was included in income. You can file a 
claim on Form 1040-X if the statute of limitations for filing a claim is still open. The statute of limitations 
generally does not end until 3 years after the due date of your original return.
Exceptions
There are several exceptions to the inclusion of canceled debt in income, including:
• The debt is canceled in a bankruptcy case under title 11 of the U.S. Code. See Pub. 908, 
Bankruptcy Tax Guide.
• The debt is canceled when you are insolvent. However, you cannot exclude any amount 
of canceled debt that is more than the amount by which you are insolvent. See Pub. 908.
• The debt is qualified farm debt and is canceled by a qualified person. See chapter 3 of 
Pub 225, Farmer’s Tax Guide.
• The debt is qualified real property business debt. See chapter 5 of Pub. 334.
• The cancellation is intended as a gift.
• The debt is qualified principal residence indebtedness.
• Student loan cancellation due to meeting certain work requirements.
• Cancellation of certain loans after December 31, 2020, and before January 1, 2026.
• Certain student loan repayment assistance programs.
I V.  LIFE INSURANCE PROCEEDS  
Life insurance proceeds paid to you because of the death of the insured person are not taxable unless 
the  policy  was  turned  over  to  you  for  a  price.  This  is  true  even  if  the  proceeds  were  paid  under  an  
accident or health insurance policy or an endowment contract. However, interest income received as a 
result of life insurance proceeds may be taxable. 

 122  •  Chapter 12: Other Income
Proceeds not received in installments. If death benefits are paid to you in a lump sum or other than at 
regular intervals, include in your income only the benefits that are more than the amount payable to you 
at the time of the insured person’s death. If the benefit payable at death is not specified, you include in 
your income the benefit payments that are more than the present value of the payments at the time of 
death. 
Proceeds  received  in  installments. If you receive life insurance proceeds in installments, you can 
exclude part of each installment from your income. 
To determine the excluded part, divide the amount held by the insurance company (generally the total 
lump sum payable at the death of the insured person) by the number of installments to be paid. Include 
anything over this excluded part in your income as interest. 
Surviving spouse. If your spouse died before October 23, 1986, and insurance proceeds paid to you 
because of the death of your spouse are received in installments, you can exclude up to $1,000 a year 
of the interest included in the installments. If you remarry, you can continue to take the exclusion. 
Surrender  of  policy  for  cash. If you surrender a life insurance policy for cash, you must include in 
income any proceeds that are more than the cost of the life insurance policy. In most cases, your cost 
(or investment in the contract) is the total of premiums that you paid for the life insurance policy, less any 
refunded premiums, rebates, dividends, or unrepaid loans that were not included in your income. 
You  should  receive  a  Form  1099-R  showing  the  total  proceeds  and  the  taxable  part.  Report  these 
amounts on lines 5a and 5b of Form 1040 or 1040-SR. 
ENDOWMENT CONTRACT PROCEEDS
Endowment proceeds paid in a lump sum to you at maturity are taxable only if the proceeds are more 
than the cost of the policy. To determine your cost, add the aggregate amount of premiums (or other 
consideration) paid for the contract and subtract any amount that you previously received under the 
contract and excluded from your income. Include in your income the part of the lump sum payment that 
is more than your cost in your income. 
ACCELERATED DEATH BENEFITS  
Certain amounts paid as accelerated death benefits under a life insurance contract or viatical settlement 
before the insured’s death are excluded from income if the insured is terminally or chronically ill. 
Viatical settlement. This is the sale or assignment of any part of the death benefit under a life insurance 
contract  to  a  viatical  settlement  provider.  A  viatical  settlement  provider  is  a  person  who  regularly  
engages in the business of buying or taking assignment of life insurance contracts on the lives of insured 
individuals who are terminally or chronically ill and who meets the requirements of section 101(g)(2)(B) 
of the Internal Revenue Code. 
Exclusion  for  terminal  illness.  Accelerated  death  benefits  are  fully  excludable  if  the  insured  is  a 
terminally ill individual. This is a person who has been certified by a physician as having an illness or 

 123  •  Chapter 12: Other Income
physical condition that can reasonably be expected to result in death within 24 months from the date of 
the certification. 
Exclusion  for  chronic  illness.  If  the  insured  is  a  chronically  ill  individual  who  is  not  terminally  ill, 
accelerated death benefits paid on the basis of costs incurred for qualified long-term care services are 
fully excludable. Accelerated death benefits paid on a per diem or other periodic basis are excludable 
up to a limit. This limit applies to the total of the accelerated death benefits and any periodic payments 
received from long-term care insurance contracts. 
Exception
The exclusion does not apply to any amount paid to a person (other than the insured) 
who has an insurable interest in the life of the insured because the insured:
• Is a director, officer, or employee of the other person, or 
• Has a financial interest in the person’s business.
V.   PARTNERSHIP INCOME 
A partnership generally is not a taxable entity. The income, gains, losses, deductions, and credits of a 
partnership are passed through to the partners based on each partner’s distributive share of these items. 
Schedule  K-1  (Form  1065).  Although a partnership generally pays no tax, it must file an information 
return  on  Form  1065, U.S.  Return  of  Partnership  Income,  and  send  Schedule  K-1  (Form  1065)  to 
each partner. In addition, the partnership will send each partner a copy of the Partner’s  Instructions  
for Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) to help each partner report his or her share of the partnership’s income, 
deductions, credits, and tax preference items. 
Records. Keep Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) for your records. Do not attach it to your Form 1040 or 1040-
SR, unless you are specifically required to do so. 
VI. S CORPOR ATION INCOME  
In most cases, an S corporation does not pay tax on its income. Instead, the income, losses, deductions, 
and credits of the corporation are passed through to the shareholders based on each shareholder’s pro 
rata share. 
Schedule  K-1  (Form  1120S).  An S corporation must file a return on Form 1120-S, U.S.  Income  Tax  
Return  for  an  S  Corporation, and send Schedule K-1 (Form 1120-S) to each shareholder. In addition, 
the S corporation will send each shareholder a copy of the Shareholder’s Instructions for Schedule K-1 
(Form 1120-S) to help each shareholder report his or her share of the S corporation’s income, losses, 
credits, and deductions. 

 124  •  Chapter 12: Other Income
Records. Keep Schedule K-1 (Form 1120-S) for your records. Do not attach it to your Form 1040 or 
1040-SR, unless you are required to do so. 
For more information on S corporations and their shareholders, see the instructions for Form 1120-S.
VII. RECOVERIES  
A recovery is a return of an amount you deducted or took a credit for in an earlier year. The most 
common recoveries are refunds, reimbursements, and rebates of deductions itemized on Schedule A 
(Form 1040). You may also have recoveries of non-itemized deductions (such as payments on previously 
deducted bad debts) and recoveries of items for which you previously claimed a tax credit. 
Tax benefit rule. You must include a recovery in your income in the year you receive it up to the amount 
by which the deduction or credit you took for the recovered amount reduced your tax in the earlier year. 
For this purpose, any increase to an amount carried over to the current year that resulted from the 
deduction or credit is considered to have reduced your tax in the earlier year. 
Federal income tax refund. Refunds of federal income taxes are not included in your income because 
they are never allowed as a deduction from income. 
State tax  refund.  If  you  received  a  state  or  local  income  tax refund (or credit or offset) in 2024, you 
generally  must  include  it  in  income  if  you  deducted  the  tax  in  an  earlier  year.  The  payer  should  send  
Form 1099-G, Certain Government Payments, to you by January 31, 2025. The IRS will also receive a 
copy of the Form 1099-G. Use the State and Local Tax Refund Worksheet in the 2024 Form 1040  or 
1040-SR Instructions for Schedule 1 to figure the amount (if any) to include in your income. 
If you could choose to deduct for a tax year either:
• State and local income taxes, or
• State and local general sales taxes, then
the maximum refund that you may have to include in income is limited to the excess of the tax you chose 
to deduct for that year over the tax you did not choose to deduct for that year.
Mortgage  interest  refund. If you received a refund or credit in 2024 of mortgage  interest  paid  in  an  
earlier year, the amount should be shown in box 4 of your Form 1098, Mortgage Interest Statement. Do 
not subtract the refund amount from the interest you paid in 2024. You may have to include it in your 
income under the rules explained in the following discussions. 
Interest on recovery. Interest on any of the amounts you recover must be reported as interest income 
in the year received. For example, report any interest you received on state or local income tax refunds 
on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 2b. 
Recovery  and  expense  in  same  year.  If  the  refund  or  other  recovery  and  the  expense  occur  in  the  
same year, the recovery reduces the deduction or credit and is not reported as income. 

 125  •  Chapter 12: Other Income
Recovery for 2 or more years. If you receive a refund or other recovery that is for amounts you paid 
in 2 or more separate years, you must allocate, on a pro rata basis, the recovered amount between the 
years in which you paid it. This allocation is necessary to determine the amount of recovery from any 
earlier years and to determine the amount, if any, of your allowable deduction for this item for the current 
year. 
VIII. RENTS FROM PERSONAL PROPERTY 
If  you  rent  out  personal  property,  such  as  equipment  or  vehicles,  how  you  report  your  income  and 
expenses is generally determined by:  
1. Whether or not the rental activity is a business, and 
2. Whether or not the rental activity is conducted for profit. 
In most cases, if your primary purpose is income or profit and you are involved in the rental activity with 
continuity and regularity, your rental activity is a business. 
Reporting  business  income  and  expenses. If you are in the business of renting personal property, 
report your income and expenses on Schedule C (Form 1040). The form instructions have information 
on how to complete them. 
Reporting nonbusiness income. If you are not in the business of renting personal property, report your 
rental income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8l.  
Reporting nonbusiness expenses. If you rent personal property for profit, include your rental expenses 
in the total amount you enter on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 24b. 
If you do not rent personal property for profit, your deductions are limited and you cannot report a loss to 
offset other income.
IX. R E PAY M E N T S 
If you had to repay an amount that you included in your income in an earlier year, you may be able to 
deduct the amount repaid from your income for the year in which you repaid it. Or, if the amount you 
repaid is more than $3,000, you may be able to take a credit against your tax for the year in which you 
repaid it. Generally, you can claim a deduction or credit only if the repayment qualifies as an expense or 
loss incurred in your trade or business or in a for-profit transaction. 
Type  of  deduction.  The  type  of  deduction  you  are  allowed  in  the  year  of  repayment  depends  on  the  
type of income you included in the earlier year. You generally deduct the repayment on the same form 
or schedule on which you previously reported it as income. For example, if you reported it as self-
employment income, deduct it as a business expense on Schedule C (Form 1040) or Schedule F (Form 
1040). If you reported it as a capital gain, deduct it as a capital loss on Schedule D (Form 1040). If you 
reported it as wages, unemployment compensation, or other nonbusiness income, you may be able to 
deduct it as an other itemized deduction if the amount repaid is over $3,000.

 126  •  Chapter 12: Other Income
Caution!
In 2024, you cannot claim any miscellaneous itemized deductions, so if the amount 
repaid was $3,000 or less, you are not able to deduct it from your income in the year 
you repaid it.
Repayment over $3,000. If the amount you repaid was more than $3,000, you can deduct the repayment 
as an other itemized deduction on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 16, if you included the income under 
a claim of right. This means that at the time you included the income, it appeared that you had an 
unrestricted right to it. However, you can choose to take a credit for the year of repayment. Figure your 
tax under both methods and compare the results. Use the method (deduction or credit) that results in 
less tax.
Caution!
When determining whether the amount you repaid was more or less than $3,000, 
consider the total amount being repaid on the return. Each instance of repayment is 
not considered separately.
Method 1. Figure your tax for 2024 claiming a deduction for the repaid amount. If you deduct it as an 
other itemized deduction, enter it on  Schedule A (Form 1040), line 16. 
Method 2. Figure your tax for 2024 claiming a credit for the repaid amount. Follow these steps.  
1. Figure your tax for 2024 without deducting the repaid amount. 
2. Refigure your tax from the earlier year without including in income the amount you repaid 
in 2024. 
3. Subtract the tax in (2) from the tax shown on your return for the earlier year. This is the 
credit. 
4. Subtract the answer in (3) from the tax for 2024 figured without the deduction (Step 1).  
If method 1 results in less tax, deduct the amount repaid. If method 2 results in less tax, claim the credit 
figured in (3) above on Schedule 3 (Form 1040), line 13b, by adding the amount of the credit to any other 
credits on this line, and see the instructions there. 
X. ROYA LTIES 
Royalties from copyrights, patents, and oil, gas, and mineral properties are taxable as ordinary income. 

 127  •  Chapter 12: Other Income
In most cases, you report royalties in Part I of Schedule E (Form 1040). However, if you hold an operating 
oil, gas, or mineral interest or are in business as a self-employed writer, inventor, artist, etc., report your 
income and expenses on Schedule C (Form 1040). 
Copyrights  and  patents.  Royalties from copyrights on literary, musical, or artistic works, and similar 
property, or from patents on inventions, are amounts paid to you for the right to use your work over a 
specified period of time. Royalties are generally based on the number of units sold, such as the number 
of books, tickets to a performance, or machines sold. 
Oil, gas, and minerals. Royalty income from oil, gas, and mineral properties is the amount you receive 
when  natural  resources  are  extracted  from  your  property.  The  royalties are based on units, such as 
barrels, tons, etc., and are paid to you by a person or company who leases the property from you. 
Depletion. If you are the owner of an economic interest in mineral deposits or oil and gas wells, you can 
recover your investment through the depletion allowance. 
Coal and iron ore. Under certain circumstances, you can treat amounts you receive from the disposal 
of coal and iron ore as payments from the sale of a capital asset, rather than as royalty income. 
Sale of property interest. If you sell your complete interest in oil, gas, or mineral rights, the amount you 
receive is considered payment for the sale of section 1231 property, not royalty income. Under certain 
circumstances, the sale is subject to capital gain or loss treatment on Schedule D (Form 1040). For more 
information on selling section 1231 property, see chapter 3 of Publication 544. If you retain a royalty, an 
overriding royalty, or a net profit interest in a mineral property for the life of the property, you have made 
a lease or a sublease, and any cash you receive for the assignment of other interests in the property is 
ordinary income subject to a depletion allowance. 
Part of future production sold. If you own mineral property but sell part of the future production, you 
generally treat the money you receive from the buyer at the time of the sale as a loan from the buyer. Do 
not include it in your income or take depletion based on it. 
When production begins, you include all the proceeds in your income, deduct all the production expenses, 
and deduct depletion from that amount to arrive at your taxable income from the property.
XI. UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS 
The tax treatment of unemployment benefits you receive depends on the type of program paying the 
benefits. 
Unemployment compensation. You must include in your income all unemployment compensation you 
received. You should receive a Form 1099-G, Certain Government Payments, showing in box 1 the total 
unemployment compensation paid to you. In most cases, you enter unemployment  compensation  on  
Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 7. 
Types of unemployment compensation. Unemployment compensation generally includes any amount 
received  under  an  unemployment  compensation  law  of  the  United  States  or  of  a  state.  It  includes  the  
following benefits.

 128  •  Chapter 12: Other Income
• Benefits paid by a state or the District of Columbia from the Federal Unemployment Trust 
Fund. 
• State unemployment insurance benefits. 
• Railroad unemployment compensation benefits.
• Disability payments from a government program paid as a substitute for unemployment 
compensation. (Amounts received as workers’ compensation for injuries or illness are not 
unemployment compensation. See chapter 5 for more information.)
• Trade readjustment allowances under the Trade Act of 1974. 
• Unemployment assistance under the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act.
• Unemployment assistance under the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 program.
Governmental  program. If you contribute to a governmental unemployment  compensation  program  
and your contributions are not deductible, amounts you receive under the program are not included as 
unemployment compensation until you recover your contributions. If you deducted all of your contributions 
to the program, the entire amount you receive under the program is included in your income.
Repayment of unemployment compensation. If you repaid in 2024 unemployment compensation you 
received in 2024, subtract the amount you repaid from the total amount you received and enter the 
difference on line 7 of Schedule 1 (Form 1040). On the dotted line next to your entry enter “Repaid” and 
the amount you repaid. If you repaid unemployment compensation in 2024 that you included in income 
in an earlier year, you can deduct the amount repaid on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 16 if you itemize 
deductions and if the amount is more than $3,000. 
Tax  withholding.  You  can  choose  to  have  federal  income  tax  withheld  from  your  unemployment 
compensation. To make this choice, complete Form W-4V, Voluntary Withholding Request, and give it to 
the paying office. Tax will be withheld at 10% of your payment. 
Supplemental unemployment benefits. Benefits received from an employer-financed fund (to which 
the employees did not contribute) are not unemployment compensation. They are taxable as wages. 
Report these payments on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 1a. 
Repayment of benefits. You may have to repay some of your supplemental unemployment benefits 
to qualify for trade readjustment allowances under the Trade Act of 1974. If you repay supplemental 
unemployment benefits in the same year you receive them, reduce the total benefits by the amount you 
repay. If you repay the benefits in a later year, you must include the full amount of the benefits received 
in your income for the year you received them. 
Deduct the repayment in the later year as an adjustment to gross income on Form 1040 or 1040-SR. 
Include the repayment on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 24e. If the amount you repay in a later year 
is more than $3,000, you may be able to take a credit against your tax for the later year instead of 
deducting the amount repaid. For more information on this, see Repayments, earlier. 

 129  •  Chapter 12: Other Income
Private  unemployment  fund.  Unemployment  benefit  payments  from  a  private  fund  to  which  you 
voluntarily contribute are taxable only if the amounts you receive are more than your total payments into 
the fund. Report the taxable amount on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8z. 
Payments by a union. Benefits paid to you as an unemployed member of a union from regular union 
dues are included in your gross income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8z. However, if you contribute 
to a special union fund and your payments to the fund are not deductible, the unemployment benefits 
you receive from the fund are includible in your income only to the extent they are more than your 
contributions. 
Guaranteed annual wage. Payments you receive from your employer during periods of unemployment, 
under a union agreement that guarantees you full pay during the year, are taxable as wages. Include 
them on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 1a. 
State employees. Payments similar to a state’s unemployment compensation may be made by the state 
to its employees who are not covered by the state’s unemployment  compensation  law.  Although  the  
payments are fully taxable, do not report them as unemployment compensation. Report these payments 
on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8z.
XII. OTHER INCOME 
The following brief discussions are arranged in alphabetical order. Income items that are discussed in 
greater detail in another publication include a reference to that publication. 
Activity not for profit. You must include on your return income from an activity from which you do not 
expect to make a profit. An example of this type of activity is a hobby or a farm you operate mostly for 
recreation and pleasure. Enter this income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8j. Deductions for expenses 
related to the activity are limited. They cannot total more than the income you report and can be taken 
only if you itemize deductions on Schedule A (Form 1040). 
Alimony. Include in your income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 2a any taxable alimony payments 
you  receive.  Amounts  you  receive  for  child  support  are  not  income  to  you.  Alimony  and  child  support  
payments are discussed in chapter 18.
Caution!
Do not include alimony payments you receive under a divorce or separation agreement 
(1) executed after 2018, or (2) executed before 2019 but later modified if the modification 
expressly  states  the  repeal  of  the  deduction  for  alimony  payments  applies  to  the 
modification.
Campaign contributions. These contributions are not income to a candidate unless they are diverted 
to his or her personal use. To be nontaxable, the contributions must be spent for campaign purposes 
or kept in a fund for use in future campaigns. However, interest earned on bank deposits, dividends 

 130  •  Chapter 12: Other Income
received on contributed securities, and net gains realized on sales of contributed securities are taxable 
and must be reported on Form 1120-POL, U.S. Income Tax Return for Certain Political Organizations. 
Excess campaign funds transferred to an office account must be included in the officeholder’s income on 
Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8z, in the year transferred. 
Cash  rebates.  A cash rebate you receive from a dealer or manufacturer of an item you buy is not 
income, but you must reduce your basis by the amount of the rebate.
Example
You buy a new car for $24,000 cash and receive a $2,000 rebate check from the 
manufacturer. The $2,000 is not income to you. Your cost is $22,000. This is your 
basis on which you figure gain or loss if you sell the car, and depreciation if you use it 
for business. 
Court  awards  and  damages.  To  determine  if  settlement  amounts  you  receive  by  compromise  or 
judgment must be included in your income, you must consider the item that the settlement replaces. 
The character of the income as ordinary income or capital gain depends on the nature of the underlying 
claim. Include the following as ordinary income.
1. Interest on any award. 
2. Compensation for lost wages or lost profits in most cases. 
3. Punitive damages, in most cases. It does not matter if they relate to a physical injury or 
physical sickness. 
4. Amounts received in settlement of pension rights (if you did not contribute to the plan).
5. Damages for:  
a) Patent or copyright infringement, 
b) Breach of contract, or 
c) Interference with business operations. 
6. Back pay and damages for emotional distress received to satisfy a claim under Title VII of 
the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
7. Attorney  fees  and  costs  (including  contingent  fees)  where  the  underlying  recovery  is  
included in gross income.
8. Attorney fees and costs relating to whistleblower awards where the underlying recovery is 
included in gross income.
Do not include in your income compensatory damages for personal physical injury or physical sickness 
(whether received in a lump sum or installments). 

 131  •  Chapter 12: Other Income
Emotional distress. Damages you receive for emotional distress due to a physical injury or sickness 
are treated as received for the physical injury or sickness. Do not include them in your income. If the 
emotional  distress  is  due  to  a  personal  injury  that  is  unrelated  to  a  physical  injury  or  sickness  (for 
example, employment discrimination or injury to reputation), you must include the damages in your 
income, except for any damages that are not more than amounts paid for medical care due to that 
emotional distress. Emotional distress includes physical symptoms that result from emotional distress, 
such as headaches, insomnia, and stomach disorders. 
Credit  card  insurance.  In  most  cases,  if  you  receive  benefits  under  a  credit  card  disability  or 
unemployment insurance plan, the benefits are taxable to you. These plans make the minimum monthly 
payment on your credit card account if you cannot make the payment due to injury, illness, disability, or 
unemployment. Report on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8z, the amount of benefits you received during 
the year that is more than the amount of the premiums you paid during the year. 
Energy  conservation  subsidies.  You can exclude from gross income any subsidy provided, either 
directly or indirectly, by public utilities for the purchase or installation of an energy conservation measure 
for a dwelling unit. 
Energy conservation measure. This includes installations or modifications that are primarily designed 
to reduce consumption of electricity or natural gas, or improve the management of energy demand. 
Dwelling unit. This includes a house, apartment, condominium, mobile home, boat, or similar property. 
If a building or structure contains both dwelling and other units, any subsidy must be properly allocated. 
Estate and trust income. An estate or trust, unlike a partnership, may have to pay federal income tax. 
If you are a beneficiary of an estate or trust, you may be taxed on your share of its income distributed 
or required to be distributed to you. However, there is never a double tax. Estates and trusts file their 
returns on Form 1041, U.S. Income Tax Return for Estates and Trusts, and your share of the income is 
reported to you on Schedule K-1 of Form 1041. 
Current  income  required  to  be  distributed. If you are the beneficiary of a trust that must distribute 
all of its current income, you must report your share of the distributable net income, whether or not you 
actually received it. 
Current income not required to be distributed. If you are the beneficiary of an estate or trust and the 
fiduciary has the choice of whether to distribute all or part of the current income, you must report:
• All income that is required to be distributed to you, whether or not it is actually distributed, 
plus 
• All other amounts actually paid or credited to you, 
up to the amount of your share of distributable net income. 
Losses. Losses of estates and trusts generally are not deductible by the beneficiaries. 

 132  •  Chapter 12: Other Income
Grantor  trust. Income earned by a grantor trust is taxable to the grantor, not the beneficiary, if the 
grantor keeps certain control over the trust. (The grantor is the one who transferred property to the trust.) 
This rule applies if the property (or income from the property) put into the trust will or may revert (be 
returned) to the grantor or the grantor’s spouse. 
Generally, a trust is a grantor trust if the grantor has a reversionary interest valued (at the date of transfer) 
at more than 5% of the value of the transferred property. 
Fees for services. Include all fees for your services in your income. Examples of these fees are amounts 
you receive for services you perform as: 
• A corporate director, 
• An executor, administrator, or personal representative of an estate, 
• A manager of a trade or business you operated before declaring Chapter 11 bankruptcy,
• A notary public, or 
• An election precinct official. 
Nonemployee compensation. If you are not an employee and the fees for your services from the same 
payer total $600 or more for the year, you may receive a Form 1099-NEC. You may need to report your 
fees as self-employment income. 
Corporate  director.  Corporate  director  fees  are  self-employment  income.  Report  these  payments  on  
Schedule C (Form 1040). 
Personal representatives. All personal representatives must include in their gross income fees paid to 
them from an estate. If you are not in the trade or business of being an executor (for instance, you are 
the executor of a friend’s or relative’s estate), report these fees on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8z. If 
you provide the services as a trade or business, report them as self-employment income on Schedule C 
(Form 1040). The fee is not includible in income if it is waived. 
Gambling winnings. You must include your gambling winnings in income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), 
line 8b. If you itemize your deductions on Schedule A (Form 1040), you can deduct gambling losses you 
had during the year, but only up to the amount of your winnings. If you are in the trade or business of 
gambling, use Schedule C (Form 1040).
Lotteries and raffles. Winnings from lotteries and raffles are gambling winnings. In addition to cash 
winnings, you must include in your income the fair market value of bonds, cars, houses, and other 
noncash prizes. 
Form W-2G. You may have received a Form W-2G, Certain Gambling Winnings, showing the amount 
of your gambling winnings and any tax taken out of them. Include the amount from box 1 on Schedule 
1 (Form 1040), line 8b. Include the amount shown in box 4 on line 25c of Form 1040 or 1040-SR as 
federal income tax withheld. 

 133  •  Chapter 12: Other Income
Gifts  and  inheritances. In most cases, property you receive as a gift, bequest, or inheritance is not 
included  in  your  income.  However,  if  property  you  receive  this  way  later  produces  income  such  as 
interest, dividends, or rents, that income is taxable to you. If property is given to a trust and the income 
from it is paid, credited, or distributed to you, that income is also taxable to you. If the gift, bequest, or 
inheritance is the income from the property, that income is taxable to you. 
Inherited pension or IRA. If you inherited a pension or an individual retirement arrangement (IRA), you 
may have to include part of the inherited amount in your income. 
Hobby losses. Losses from a hobby are not deductible from other income. A hobby is an activity from 
which you do not expect to make a profit. See Activity not for profit, earlier. 
Interest on qualified savings bonds.  You  may  be  able  to  exclude  from  income  the  interest  from 
qualified U.S. savings bonds you redeem if you pay qualified higher educational expenses in the same 
year. 
Job interview expenses. If a prospective employer asks you to appear for an interview and either pays 
you an allowance or reimburses you for your transportation and other travel expenses, the amount you 
receive is generally not taxable. You include in income only the amount you receive that is more than 
your actual expenses. 
Jury duty. Jury duty pay you receive must be included in your income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 
8h. If you gave any of your jury duty pay to your employer because your employer continued to pay your 
salary while you served jury duty, include the amount you gave your employer as income adjustment on 
Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 24a. 
Kickbacks. You  must  include  kickbacks,  side  commissions,  push  money,  or  similar  payments  you 
receive in your income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8z, or on Schedule C (Form 1040), if from your 
self-employment activity. 
Example
You sell cars and help arrange car insurance for buyers. Insurance brokers pay back 
part of their commissions to you for referring customers to them. You must include the 
kickbacks in your income.
Medical savings accounts (MSAs). In most cases, you do not include in income amounts you withdraw 
from your Archer MSA or Medicare Advantage MSA if you use the money to pay for qualified medical 
expenses. Generally, qualified medical expenses are those you can deduct on Schedule A (Form 1040). 
For more information about qualified medical expenses, see chapter 22. 
Prizes  and  awards. If you win a prize in a lucky number drawing, television or radio quiz program, 
beauty contest, or other event, you must include it in your income. For example, if you win a $50 prize in 
a photography contest, you must report this income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8i. If you refuse to 
accept a prize, do not include its value in your income. 

 134  •  Chapter 12: Other Income
Prizes and awards in goods or services must be included in your income at their fair market value. 
Employee  awards  or  bonuses.  Cash  awards  or  bonuses given to you by your employer for good 
work or suggestions generally must be included in your income as wages. However, certain noncash 
employee achievement awards can be excluded from income. 
Pulitzer, Nobel, and similar prizes. If you were awarded a prize in recognition of past accomplishments 
in religious, charitable, scientific, artistic, educational, literary, or civic fields, you generally must include 
the value of the prize in your income. However, you do not include this prize in your income if you meet 
all of the following requirements. 
• You were selected without any action on your part to enter the contest or proceeding. 
• You are not required to perform substantial future services as a condition to receiving the 
prize or award. 
• The prize or award is transferred by the payer directly to a governmental unit or tax-
exempt charitable organization as designated by you. 
Qualified Opportunity Fund (QOF). Effective December 22, 2017, Code section 1400Z-2 provides 
a temporary deferral on inclusion in gross income for capital gains invested in QOFs, and permanent 
exclusion of capital gains from the sale or exchange of an investment in the QOF if the investment is 
held for at least 10 years. See the Instructions for Form 8949 on how to report your election to defer 
eligible gains invested in a QOF. See the instructions for Form 8997, Initial and Annual Statement of 
Qualified Opportunity Fund (QOF) Investments, for reporting information.
Qualified tuition programs. A qualified tuition program (also known as a 529 program) is a program set 
up to allow you to either prepay, or contribute to an account established for paying, a student’s qualified 
higher education expenses at an eligible educational institution. 
The part of a distribution representing the amount paid or contributed to a QTP is not included in income. 
This is a return of the investment in the program.
In most cases, the beneficiary does not include in income any earnings distributed from a QTP established 
and maintained by a state (or an agency or instrumentality of the state) if the total distribution is less than 
or equal to adjusted qualified higher education expenses. 
Sale of home. You may be able to exclude from income all or part of any gain from the sale or exchange 
of your main home. See chapter 15. 
Sale  of  personal  items. If you sold an item you owned for personal use, such as a car, refrigerator, 
furniture, stereo, jewelry, or silverware, your gain is taxable as a capital gain. Report it on Schedule D 
(Form 1040). You cannot deduct a loss. 
However, if you sold an item you held for investment, such as gold or silver bullion, coins, or gems, any 
gain is taxable as a capital gain and any loss is deductible as a capital loss. 

 135  •  Chapter 12: Other Income
Scholarships and fellowships. A candidate for a degree can exclude amounts received as a qualified 
scholarship or fellowship. A qualified scholarship or fellowship is any amount you receive that is for: 
• Tuition and fees to enroll at or attend an educational institution, or 
• Fees, books, supplies, and equipment required for courses at the educational institution. 
Amounts used for room and board do not qualify for the exclusion.
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) payments. Allowances paid by the VA are not included in your 
income. These allowances are not considered scholarship or fellowship grants. 
Prizes. Scholarship  prizes  won  in  a  contest  are  not  scholarships  or  fellowships  if  you  do  not  have  to  
use the prizes for educational purposes. You must include these amounts in your income on Schedule 1 
(Form 1040), line 8i, whether or not you use the amounts for educational purposes. 
Union benefits and dues. Amounts deducted from your pay for union dues, assessments, contributions, 
or other payments to a union cannot be excluded from your income. 
Strike and lockout benefits. Benefits paid to you by a union as strike or lockout benefits, including both 
cash and the fair market value of other property, are usually included in your income as compensation. 
You  can  exclude  these  benefits  from  your  income  only  when  the  facts  clearly  show  that  the  union 
intended them as gifts to you.

gains from the sale or exchange of an investment in a QOF if the investment is held for at least 10 years. 
For more information, see the Instructions for Form 8949.
II. INTRODUCTION 
This chapter discusses how to figure your basis in property. It is divided into the following sections. 
• Cost basis. 
• Adjusted basis. 
• Basis other than cost. 
Basis is the amount of your investment in property for tax purposes. Use the basis of property to figure 
gain or loss on the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property. Also use it to figure deductions for 
depreciation, amortization, depletion, and casualty losses.
If you use property for both business and personal purposes, you must allocate the basis based on the 
use. Only the basis allocated to the business use of the property can be depreciated.
Your  original  basis  in  property  is  adjusted  (increased  or  decreased)  by  certain  events.  If  you  make 
improvements to the property, increase your basis. If you take deductions for depreciation or casualty 
losses, or claim certain credits, reduce your basis. 
III. COST BASIS 
The basis of property you buy is usually its cost. The cost is the amount you pay in cash, debt obligations, 
other property, or services. Your cost also includes amounts you pay for the following items. 
• Sales tax. 

 141  •  Chapter 13: Basis of Property
• Freight. 
• Installation and testing. 
• Excise taxes. 
• Legal and accounting fees (when they must be capitalized). 
• Revenue stamps. 
• Recording fees. 
• Real estate taxes (if assumed for the seller). 
In  addition,  you  may  also  have  to  capitalize  (add  to  basis)  certain  other  costs  related  to  buying  or 
producing property. 
Loans  with  low  or  no  interest.  If you buy property on a time-payment plan that charges little or no 
interest, the basis of your property is your stated purchase price minus any amount considered to be 
unstated interest. You generally have unstated interest if your interest rate is less than the applicable 
federal rate. 
REAL PROPERTY 
Real property, also called real estate, is land and generally anything built on, growing on, or attached to 
land. 
If you buy real property, certain fees and other expenses you pay are part of your cost basis in the 
property. 
Lump sum purchase. If you buy buildings and the land on which they stand for a lump sum, allocate the 
basis among the land and the buildings so you can figure the allowable depreciation on the buildings. 
Land is not depreciable. Allocate the cost according to the fair market values of the land and buildings 
at the time of purchase. Figure the basis of each asset by multiplying the lump sum by a fraction. The 
numerator is the FMV of that asset and the denominator is the FMV of the whole property at the time of 
purchase. 
Fair  market  value  (FMV) is the price at which the property would change hands between a willing 
buyer and a willing seller, neither having to buy or sell, and both have reasonable knowledge of all the 
necessary facts. Sales of similar property on or about the same date may be helpful in figuring the FMV 
of the property. 
Assumption of mortgage. If you buy property and assume (or buy the property subject to) an existing 
mortgage on the property, your basis includes the amount you pay for the property plus the amount to be 
paid on the mortgage. 
Settlement  costs.  You can include in the basis of property you buy the settlement fees and closing 
costs for buying the property. (A fee for buying property is a cost that must be paid even if you buy the 
property for cash.) You cannot include fees and costs for getting a loan on the property in your basis. 

 142  •  Chapter 13: Basis of Property
The following are some of the settlement fees or closing costs you can include in the basis of your 
property.
• Abstract fees (abstract of title fees). 
• Charges for installing utility services. 
• Legal fees (including title search and preparation of the sales contract and deed).
• Recording fees. 
• Survey fees.
• Transfer taxes. 
• Owner’s title insurance. 
• Any  amounts  the  seller  owes  that  you  agree  to  pay,  such  as  back  taxes  or  interest, 
recording or mortgage fees, charges for improvements or repairs, and sales commissions. 
Settlement costs do not include amounts placed in escrow for the future payment of items such as taxes 
and insurance. 
The following are some of the settlement fees and closing costs you cannot include in the basis of 
property.  
1. Casualty insurance premiums. 
2. Rent for occupancy of the property before closing. 
3. Charges for utilities or other services related to occupancy of the property before closing. 
4. Charges connected with getting a loan. The following are examples of these charges.  
a) Points (discount points, loan origination fees). 
b) Mortgage insurance premiums. 
c) Loan assumption fees. 
d) Cost of a credit report. 
e) Fees for an appraisal required by a lender. 
5. Fees for refinancing a mortgage. 
Real  estate  taxes. If you pay real estate taxes the seller owed on real property you bought, and the 
seller did not reimburse you, treat those taxes as part of your basis. You cannot deduct them as an 
expense.
If you reimburse the seller for taxes the seller paid for you, you can usually deduct that amount as an 
expense in the year of purchase. Do not include that amount in the basis of your property. If you did not 
reimburse the seller, you must reduce your basis by the amount of those taxes. 

 143  •  Chapter 13: Basis of Property
Points. If you pay points to get a loan (including a mortgage, second mortgage, line of credit, or a home 
equity loan), do not add the points to the basis of the related property. Generally, you deduct the points 
over the term of the loan. For more information, see Points in chapter 24.
Points on home mortgage. Special rules may apply to points you and the seller pay when you get a 
mortgage to buy your main home. If certain requirements are met, you can deduct the points in full for 
the year in which they are paid. Reduce the basis of your home by any seller-paid points.
I V.  ADJUSTED BASIS 
Before figuring gain or loss on a sale, exchange, or other disposition of property or figuring allowable 
depreciation,  depletion,  or  amortization,  you  must  usually  make  certain  adjustments  (increases  and 
decreases) to the cost of the property. The result is the adjusted basis.
INCREASES TO BASIS 
Increase the basis of any property by all items properly added to a capital account. Examples of items 
that increase basis are shown in Table 13-1.

 144  •  Chapter 13: Basis of Property
Improvements. Add to your basis in property the cost of improvements having a useful life of more 
than one year, that increase the value of the property, lengthen its life, or adapt it to a different use. For 
example, improvements include putting a recreation room in your unfinished basement, adding another 
bathroom or bedroom, putting up a fence, putting in new plumbing or wiring, installing a new roof, or 
paving your driveway. 
Assessments for local improvements. Increase the basis of property by assessments for items such 
as paving roads and building ditches that increase the value of the property assessed. Do not deduct 
them as taxes. However, you can deduct as taxes charges for maintenance, repairs, or interest charges 
related to the improvements.
Example
Your city changes the street in front of your store into an enclosed pedestrian mall and 
assesses you and other affected property owners for the cost of the conversion. Add the 
assessment to your property’s basis. In this example, the assessment is a depreciable 
asset. 
DECREASES TO BASIS 
Decrease the basis of any property by all items that represent a return of capital for the period during 
which you held the property. Examples of items that decrease basis are shown in Table 13-1.
Casualty and theft losses. If you have a casualty or theft loss, decrease the basis in your property by 
any insurance proceeds or other reimbursement and by any deductible loss not covered by insurance. 
You must increase your basis in the property by the amount you spend on repairs that restore the 
property to its pre-casualty condition. 
Depreciation and section 179 deduction. Decrease the basis of your qualifying business property by 
any section 179 deduction you take and the depreciation you deducted, or could have deducted, on your 
tax returns under the method of depreciation you selected.
Example
You owned a duplex used as rental property that cost you $40,000, of which $35,000 
was allocated to the building and $5,000 to the land. You added an improvement to 
the duplex that cost $10,000. In February last year the duplex was damaged by fire. 
Up to that time you had been allowed depreciation of $23,000. You sold some salvaged 
material for $1,300 and collected $19,700 from your insurance company. You deducted 
a casualty loss of $1,000 on your income tax return for last year. You spent $19,000 of 
the insurance proceeds for restoration of the duplex, which was completed this year.

 145  •  Chapter 13: Basis of Property
Example (continued)
You must use the duplex’s adjusted basis after the restoration to determine depreciation 
for the rest of the property’s recovery period. Figure the adjusted basis of the duplex as 
follows: 
Original cost of duplex$35,000
Addition to duplex10,000
Total cost of duplex$45,000
Minus: Depreciation23,000
Adjusted basis before casualty$22,000
Minus: Insurance proceeds$19,700
Deducted casualty loss1,000
Salvage proceeds1,30022,000
Adjusted basis after casualty-0-
Add: Cost of restoring duplex$19,000
Adjusted basis after restoration$19,000
Note: Your basis in the land is its original cost of $5,000.
Easements. The amount you receive for granting an easement is generally considered to be from the 
sale of an interest in real property. It reduces the basis of the affected part of the property. If the amount 
received is more than the basis of the part of the property affected by the easement, reduce your basis in 
that part to zero and treat the excess as a recognized gain.
Vehicle credits. Unless you elect not to claim the qualified vehicle credit, the alternative motor vehicle 
credit, or the qualified plug-in electric drive motor vehicle credit, you may have to reduce the basis of 
each qualified vehicle by certain amounts reported.
Exclusion  of  subsidies  for  energy  conservation  measures.  You  can  exclude  from  gross  income  
any subsidy you received from a public utility company for the purchase or installation of an energy 
conservation measure for a dwelling unit. Reduce the basis of the property for which you received the 
subsidy by the excluded amount. For more information about this subsidy, see chapter 12. 
V.   BASIS OTHER THAN COST 
There are many times when you cannot use cost as basis. In these cases, the fair market value or the 
adjusted basis of the property can be used. Fair market value (FMV) and adjusted basis were discussed 
earlier. 

 146  •  Chapter 13: Basis of Property
TAXABLE EXCHANGES 
A taxable exchange is one in which the gain is taxable or the loss is deductible. A taxable gain or 
deductible loss also is known as a recognized gain or loss. If you receive property in exchange for other 
property in a taxable exchange, the basis of the property you receive is usually its FMV at the time of the 
exchange. 
NONTAXABLE EXCHANGES  
A nontaxable exchange is an exchange in which you are not taxed on any gain and you cannot deduct 
any loss. If you receive property in a nontaxable exchange, its basis is generally the same as the basis 
of the property you transferred. 
Like-Kind Exchanges  
The exchange of property for the same kind of property may qualify as a nontaxable exchange under 
section 1031. Nontaxable like-kind exchange treatment under section 1031 applies only to exchanges of 
real property held for use in a trade or business or for investment, other than real property held primarily 
for sale. Beginning after 2017, nontaxable like-kind exchange treatment under section 1031 applies 
only to exchanges of real property held for use in a trade or business or for investment other than real 
property held primarily for sale.
To qualify as a like-kind exchange, you must hold for business or investment purposes both the property 
you transfer and the property you receive. There also must be an exchange of like-kind property. 
The basis of the property you receive generally is the same as the adjusted basis of the property you 
gave up. If you trade property in a like-kind exchange and also pay money, the basis of the property 
received is the adjusted basis of the property you gave up increased by the money you paid. 
Partially nontaxable exchange. A partially nontaxable exchange is an exchange in which you receive 
unlike property or money in addition to like property. The basis of the property you receive is the total 
adjusted basis of the property you gave up, with the following adjustments.  
1. Decrease the basis by the following amounts.  
a) Any money you receive. 
b) Any loss you recognize on the exchange.
2. Increase the basis by the following amounts.  
a) Any additional costs you incur. 
b) Any gain you recognize on the exchange.  
If the other party to the exchange assumes your liabilities, treat the debt assumption as money you 
received in the exchange.

 147  •  Chapter 13: Basis of Property
Allocation  of  basis. If you receive like-kind and unlike properties in the exchange, allocate the basis 
first to the unlike property, other than money, up to its FMV on the date of the exchange. The rest is the 
basis of the like-kind property. 
PROPERTY RECEIVED AS A GIFT  
To figure the basis of property you receive as a gift, you must know its adjusted basis to the donor just 
before it was given to you, its FMV at the time it was given to you, and any gift tax paid on it. 
FMV less than donor’s adjusted basis. If the FMV of the property at the time of the gift is less than 
the donor’s adjusted basis, your basis depends on whether you have a gain or a loss when you dispose 
of the property. Your basis for figuring gain is the same as the donor’s adjusted basis plus or minus any 
required adjustments to basis while you held the property. Your basis for figuring loss is its FMV when 
you received the gift plus or minus any required adjustments to basis while you held the property. See 
Adjusted Basis, earlier. 
Example
You received an acre of land as a gift. At the time of the gift, the land had a FMV of 
$8,000. The donor’s adjusted basis was $10,000. After you received the property, no 
events occurred to increase or decrease your basis. If you later sell the property for 
$12,000, you will have a $2,000 gain because you must use the donor’s adjusted basis 
at the time of the gift ($10,000) as your basis to figure gain. If you sell the property 
for $7,000, you will have a $1,000 loss because you must use the FMV at the time of 
the gift ($8,000) as your basis to figure loss. If the sales price is between $8,000 and 
$10,000, you have neither gain nor loss. 
Business property. If you hold the gift as business property, your basis for figuring any depreciation, 
depletion, or amortization deduction is the same as the donor’s adjusted basis plus or minus any required 
adjustments to basis while you hold the property. 
FMV equal to or greater than donor’s adjusted basis. If the FMV of the property is equal to or greater 
than the donor’s adjusted basis, your basis is the donor’s adjusted basis at the time you received the gift. 
Increase your basis by all or part of any gift tax paid, depending on the date of the gift, explained later. 
Also, for figuring gain or loss from a sale or other disposition or for figuring depreciation, depletion, or 
amortization deductions on business property, you must increase or decrease your basis by any required 
adjustments to basis while you held the property. See Adjusted Basis, earlier. 
If  you  received  a  gift during the tax year, increase your basis in the gift (the donor’s adjusted basis) 
by the part of the gift tax paid on it due to the net increase in value of the gift. Figure the increase by 
multiplying the gift tax paid by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the net increase in value of the 
gift and the denominator is the amount of the gift. 

 148  •  Chapter 13: Basis of Property
The net increase in value of the gift is the FMV of the gift minus the donor’s adjusted basis. The amount 
of the gift is its value for gift tax purposes after reduction by any annual exclusion and marital or charitable 
deduction that applies to the gift.
Example
In 2024, you received a gift of property from your mother that had an FMV of $50,000. 
Her adjusted basis was $20,000. The amount of the gift  for  gift tax purposes was 
$32,000 ($50,000 minus the $18,000 annual exclusion). She paid a gift tax of $6,475 
on the property. Your basis is $26,070 figured as follows:
Fair market value$50,000
Minus: adjusted basis-20,000
Net increase in value$30,000
Gift tax paid$6,475
Multiplied by ($30,000 ÷ $32,000) x.9375
Gift tax due to net increase in value$6,070
Adjusted basis of property to your mother+20,000
Your basis in property$26,070
INHERITED PROPERTY  
Your basis in property you inherit from a decedent is generally one of the following.
• The FMV of the property at the date of the decedent’s death.
• The FMV on the alternate valuation date if the personal representative for the estate 
elects to use alternate valuation. 
• The value under the special-use valuation method for real property used in farming or a 
closely held business if elected for estate tax purposes.
• The decedent’s  adjusted  basis  in  land  to  the  extent  of  the  value  excluded  from  the 
decedent’s taxable estate as a qualified conservation easement. 
If a federal estate tax return does not have to be filed, your basis in the inherited property is its appraised 
value at the date of death for state inheritance or transmission taxes.
PROPERTY CHANGED FROM PERSONAL TO BUSINESS OR RENTAL USE  
If you hold property for personal use and then change it to business use or use it to produce rent, you 
can begin to depreciate at the time of the change. To do so, you must figure its basis for depreciation at 
the time of the change. An example of changing property held for personal use to business use would be 
renting out your former main home. 

 149  •  Chapter 13: Basis of Property
Basis for depreciation. The basis for depreciation is the lesser of the following amounts. 
• The FMV of the property on the date of the change. 
• Your adjusted basis on the date of the change. 
Example
Several years ago, you paid $160,000 to have your house built on a lot that cost $25,000. 
You paid $20,000 for permanent improvements to the house and claimed a $2,000 
casualty loss deduction for damage to the house before changing the property to rental 
use last year. Because land is not depreciable, you include only the cost of the house 
when figuring the basis for depreciation.
Your adjusted basis in the house when you changed its use was $178,000 ($160,000 
+ $20,000 - $2,000). On the same date, your property had an FMV of $180,000, of 
which $15,000 was for the land and $165,000 was for the house. The basis for figuring 
depreciation on the house is its FMV on the date of the change ($165,000) because it is 
less than your adjusted basis ($178,000). 
Sale of property. If you later sell or dispose of property changed to business or rental use, the basis you 
use will depend on whether you are figuring gain or loss. 
Gain. The basis for figuring a gain is your adjusted basis in the property when you sell the property.
Example
Assume the same facts as in the previous example except that you sell the property at 
a gain after being allowed depreciation deductions of $37,500. Your adjusted basis for 
figuring gain is $165,500 ($178,000 + $25,000 (land) - $37,500). 
Loss. Figure the basis for a loss starting with the smaller of your adjusted basis or the FMV of the 
property at the time of the change to business or rental use. Then adjust this amount for the period after 
the change in the property’s use, as discussed earlier under Adjusted Basis.

 150  •  Chapter 13: Basis of Property
Example
Assume the same facts as in the previous example, except that you sell the property at 
a loss after being allowed depreciation deductions of $37,500. In this case, you would 
start with the FMV on the date of the change to rental use ($180,000), because it is 
less than the adjusted basis of $203,000 ($178,000 + $25,000) on that date. Reduce 
that amount ($180,000) by the depreciation deductions to arrive at a basis for loss of 
$142,500 ($180,000 - $37,500). 
STOCKS AND BONDS  
The basis of stocks or bonds you buy generally is the purchase price plus any costs of purchase, such 
as commissions and recording or transfer fees. If you get stocks or bonds other than by purchase, your 
basis is usually determined by the FMV or the previous owner’s adjusted basis, as discussed earlier. 
You must adjust the basis of stocks for certain events that occur after purchase. For example, if you 
receive additional stock from nontaxable stock dividends or stock splits, divide the adjusted basis of the 
old stock by the number of shares of old and new stock. This rule applies only when the additional stock 
received is identical to the stock held. Also reduce your basis when you receive nontaxable distributions. 
The nontaxable distributions are a return of capital. 
Example
In 2022 you bought 100 shares of XYZ stock for $1,000 or $10 a share. In 2023 you 
bought 100 shares of XYZ stock for $1,600 or $16 a share. In 2024 XYZ declared a 
2-for-1 stock split. You now have 200 shares of stock with a basis of $5 a share and 200 
shares with a basis of $8 a share. 
Other basis. There are other ways to figure the basis of stocks or bonds depending on how you acquired 
them. 
Identifying stocks or bonds sold. If you can adequately identify the shares of stock or the bonds you 
sold, their basis is the cost or other basis of the particular shares of stocks or bonds. If you buy and sell 
securities at various times in varying quantities and you cannot adequately identify the shares you sell, 
the basis of the securities you sell is the basis of the securities you acquired first. 
Mutual  fund  shares.  If  you  sell  mutual  funds  you  acquired  at  various  times  and  prices  and  left  on  
deposit in an account kept by a custodian or agent, you can elect to use an average basis. 
Bond premium. If you buy a taxable bond at a premium and choose to amortize the premium, reduce 
the basis of the bond by the amortized premium you deduct each year. Although you cannot deduct the 
premium on a tax-exempt bond, you must amortize the premium each year and reduce your basis in the 
bond by the amortized amount. 

 151  •  Chapter 13: Basis of Property
Original  issue  discount  (OID)  on  debt  instruments. You must increase your basis in an OID debt 
instrument by the OID you include in income for that instrument. See Original Issue Discount in Chapter 
7.

CHAPTER 13: SOLUTIONS AND SUGGESTED RESPONSES
Below are the solutions and suggested responses for the questions on the previous page(s). If you 
choose an incorrect answer, you should review the pages as indicated for each question to ensure 
comprehension of the material.
1.A. Incorrect. The amount of cash paid for a property is part of its cost basis.
B. Incorrect.  Any  debt  assumed  or  newly  acquired  in  purchasing  property  is  also  a 
component of its cost basis.
C. Incorrect.  All  other  property  or  services  provided  to  a  seller  to  induce  them  into  
transferring property is also part of the property’s cost basis.
D. CORRECT.  Fees  and/or  charges  (for  example,  points,  credit  reporting,  and  loan 
assumption fees) associated with obtaining a loan used to purchase property are not 
usually added to the property’s cost basis.
(See pages 143 to 145 of the course material.)
2.A. Incorrect. There is no requirement for the exchange of money.
B. Incorrect. A like-kind exchange requires that both of the properties involved be “qualifying 
property” as specified in the tax code, not just one of the properties.
C. CORRECT. A  like-kind  exchange  requires  that  the  property  involved  be  “like-kind 
property” as specified in the tax code.
D. Incorrect. Having the cost basis the same is not a condition required for a like-kind 
exchange to occur.
(See page 149 of the course material.)
3.A. Incorrect. There are a number of reasons that basis may change after purchase.
B. CORRECT. The  basis  of  stocks  or  bonds  may  change  after  purchase  because  of 
nontaxable stock dividends or stock splits or nontaxable distributions.
(See page 153 of the course material.)

CHAPTER 14: SALE OF PROPERTY
Chapter Objective
After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• Recognize the taxability of the sale of personal use property.
I.   INTRODUCTION 
This chapter discusses the tax consequences of selling or trading investment property. It explains:
• What is a sale or trade,
• Figuring gain or loss,
• Nontaxable trades, 
• Related party transactions,
• Capital gains or losses,
• Capital assets and noncapital assets, and
• Holding period.
II. SALES AND TRADES 
If you sold property such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or certain commodities through a broker during 
the year, you should receive, for each sale, a Form 1099-B, Proceeds From Broker and Barter Exchange 
Transactions, or an equivalent statement from the broker. You should receive a Form 1099-B for 2024 by 
February 15, 2025. It will show the gross proceeds from the sale. It may also show your basis. The IRS 
will also get a copy of Form 1099-B from the broker. 
Use Form 1099-B received from your broker to complete Form 8949 and/or Schedule D (Form 1040). 
Sale and purchase. Ordinarily, a transaction is not a trade when you voluntarily sell property for cash 
and immediately buy similar property to replace it. The sale and purchase are two separate transactions. 
But see Like-kind exchanges under Nontaxable Trades, later. 
Redemption of stock. A redemption of stock is treated as a sale or trade and is subject to the capital 
gain or loss provisions unless the redemption is a dividend or other distribution on stock. 

 155  •  Chapter 14: Sale of Property
Dividend  versus  sale  or  trade. Whether a redemption is treated as a sale, trade, dividend, or other 
distribution depends on the circumstances in each case. Both direct and indirect ownership of stock will 
be considered. The redemption is treated as a sale or trade of stock if:
1. The redemption is not essentially equivalent to a dividend (see chapter 8), 
2. There is a substantially disproportionate redemption of stock, 
3. There  is  a  complete  redemption  of  all  the  stock  of  the  corporation  owned  by  the 
shareholder, or 
4. The redemption is a distribution in partial liquidation of a corporation.  
Redemption or retirement of bonds. A redemption or retirement of bonds or notes at their maturity is 
generally treated as a sale or trade.
In addition, a significant modification of a bond is treated as a trade of the original bond for a new bond.
Surrender  of  stock.  A  surrender  of  stock  by  a  dominant  shareholder  who  retains  control  of  the 
corporation  is  treated  as  a  contribution  to capital  rather  than  as  an  immediate  loss  deductible  from 
taxable income. The surrendering shareholder must reallocate his or her basis in the surrendered shares 
to the shares he or she retains. 
HOW TO FIGURE GAIN OR LOSS 
You figure gain or loss on a sale or trade of property by subtracting the adjusted basis of the property 
from the amount you realize on the sale or trade.
Gain. If the amount you realize from a sale or trade is more than the adjusted basis of the property you 
transfer, the difference is a gain. 
Loss. If the adjusted basis of the property you transfer is more than the amount you realize, the difference 
is a loss. 
Adjusted  basis. The adjusted basis of property is your original cost or other original basis properly 
adjusted  (increased  or  decreased)  for  certain  items.  See  chapter  13  for  more  information  about 
determining the adjusted basis of property.
Amount realized. The amount you realize from a sale or trade of property is everything you receive for 
the property minus your expenses of sale (such as redemption fees, sales commissions, sales charges, 
or exit fees). Amount realized includes the money you receive plus the fair market value of any property 
or services you receive. 
If  you  finance  the  buyer’s  purchase  of  your  property  and  the  debt  instrument  does  not  provide  for 
adequate stated interest, the unstated interest that you must report as ordinary income will reduce the 
amount realized from the sale.

 156  •  Chapter 14: Sale of Property
Fair market value. Fair market value is the price at which the property would change hands between a 
buyer and a seller, neither being forced to buy or sell and both having reasonable knowledge of all the 
relevant facts. 
Example
You trade A Company stock with an adjusted basis of $7,000 for B Company stock with 
a fair market value of $10,000, which is your amount realized. Your gain is $3,000 
($10,000 minus $7,000). 
Debt paid off. A debt against the property, or against you, that is paid off as a part of the transaction, or 
that is assumed by the buyer, must be included in the amount realized. This is true even if neither you 
nor the buyer is personally liable for the debt. For example, if you sell or trade property that is subject to 
a nonrecourse loan, the amount you realize generally includes the full amount of the note assumed by 
the buyer even if the amount of the note is more than the fair market value of the property. 
Example
You sell stock that you had pledged as security for a bank loan of $8,000. Your basis 
in the stock is $6,000. The buyer pays off your bank loan and pays you $20,000 in 
cash. The amount realized is $28,000 ($20,000 plus $8,000). Your gain is $22,000 
($28,000 minus $6,000). 
Payment  of  cash. If you trade property and cash for other property, the amount you realize is the 
fair market value of the property you receive. Determine your gain or loss by subtracting the cash you 
pay plus the adjusted basis of the property you traded in from the amount you realize. If the result is a 
positive number, it is a gain. If the result is a negative number, it is a loss. 
No gain or loss. You may have to use a basis for figuring gain that is different from the basis used for 
figuring loss. In this case, you may have neither a gain nor a loss. See Basis Other Than Cost in chapter 
13. 
NONTAXABLE TRADES
Note
 
Per the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, like-kind exchanges are allowed only for real property 
after 2017.

 157  •  Chapter 14: Sale of Property
Like-kind exchanges. If you trade business or investment property for other business or investment 
property of a like kind, you do not pay tax on any gain or deduct any loss until you sell or dispose of the 
property you receive. To be nontaxable, a trade must meet all six of the following conditions.
1. The property must be business or investment property. You must hold both the property 
you trade and the property you receive for productive use in your trade or business or for 
investment. Neither property may be property used for personal purposes, such as your 
home. 
2. The property you trade and the property you receive must be real property. 
3. There must be a trade of like property. The trade of real estate for real estate is a trade 
of like property. The trade of an apartment house for a store building is a trade of like 
property. The trade of a piece of machinery for a store building is not a trade of like 
property. Real property located in the United States and real property located outside the 
United States are not like property.
4. The property must not be held primarily for sale. The property you trade and the property 
you receive must not be property you sell to customers, such as merchandise.
5. The property to be received must be identified within 45 days after the date you transfer 
the property given up in the trade.
6. The property to be received must be received by the earlier of:
a) The 180th day after the date on which you transfer the property given up in 
the trade, or
b) The due date, including extensions, for your tax return for the year in which 
the transfer of the property given up occurs.  
If you trade property with a related party in a like-kind exchange, a special rule may apply. See Related 
Party Transactions, later in this chapter.
Partly  nontaxable  exchange. If you receive cash or unlike property in addition to like property, and 
the above six conditions are met, you have a partially nontaxable trade. You are taxed on any gain 
you realize, but only up to the amount of the cash and the fair market value of the unlike property you 
receive. You cannot deduct a loss. 
Like  property  and  unlike  property  transferred. If you give up unlike property in addition to the like 
property, you must recognize gain or loss on the unlike property you give up. The gain or loss is the 
difference between the adjusted basis of the unlike property and its fair market value. 
Like  property  and  money  transferred. If all of the above conditions (1) - (6) are met, you have a 
nontaxable trade even if you pay money in addition to the like property. 
Basis of property received. To figure the basis of the property received, see Nontaxable Exchanges in 
chapter 13. 

 158  •  Chapter 14: Sale of Property
How  to  report.  You must report the trade of like property on Form 8824. If you figure a recognized 
gain or loss on Form 8824, report it on Schedule D of (Form 1040) or on Form 4797, Sales of Business 
Property, whichever applies. 
Corporate stocks. The following trades of corporate stocks generally do not result in a taxable gain or 
a deductible loss. 
Corporate reorganizations. In some instances, a company will give you common stock for preferred 
stock, preferred stock for common stock, or stock in one corporation for stock in another corporation. If 
this is a result of a merger, recapitalization, transfer to a controlled corporation, bankruptcy, corporate 
division, corporate acquisition, or other corporate reorganization, you do not recognize gain or loss. 
Stock  for  stock  of  the  same  corporation. You can exchange common stock for common stock or 
preferred stock for preferred stock in the same corporation without having a recognized gain or loss. 
This is true for a trade between two stockholders as well as a trade between a stockholder and the 
corporation. 
Convertible  stocks  and  bonds.  You  generally  will  not  have  a  recognized  gain  or  loss  if  you  convert  
bonds into stock or preferred stock into common stock of the same corporation according to a conversion 
privilege in the terms of the bond or the preferred stock certificate. 
Property  for  stock  of  a  controlled  corporation.  If  you  transfer  property  to  a  corporation  solely  in  
exchange  for  stock  in  that  corporation,  and  immediately  after  the  trade  you  are  in  control  of  the 
corporation, you ordinarily will not recognize a gain or loss. This rule applies both to individuals and 
to  groups  who  transfer  property  to  a  corporation.  It  does  not  apply  if  the  corporation  is  an  investment  
company. 
For this purpose, to be in control of a corporation, you or your group of transferors must own, immediately 
after the exchange, at least 80% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to 
vote and at least 80% of the outstanding shares of each class of nonvoting stock of the corporation. 
If this provision applies to you, you may have to attach to your return a complete statement of all facts 
pertinent to the exchange. 
U.S.  Treasury  notes  or  bonds.  You can trade certain issues of U.S. Treasury obligations for other 
issues designated by the Secretary of the Treasury, with no gain or loss recognized on the trade. 
TRANSFERS BETWEEN SPOUSES 
Generally, no gain or loss is recognized on a transfer of property from an individual to (or in trust for the 
benefit of) a spouse, or if incident to a divorce, a former spouse. This nonrecognition rule does not apply 
if the recipient spouse or former spouse is a nonresident alien. The rule also does not apply if property 
is transferred in trust and liability exceeds basis. Gains must be recognized to the extent the amount of 
the liabilities assumed by the trust, plus any liabilities on the property, exceed the adjusted basis of the 
property. 

 159  •  Chapter 14: Sale of Property
Any transfer of property to a spouse or former spouse on which gain or loss is not recognized is treated 
by the recipient as a gift and is not considered a sale or exchange. The recipient’s basis in the property 
will be the same as the adjusted basis of the giver immediately before the transfer. This carryover basis 
rule applies whether the adjusted basis of the transferred property is less than, equal to, or greater 
than either its fair market value at the time of transfer or any consideration paid by the recipient. This 
rule applies for purposes of determining loss as well as gain. Any gain recognized on a transfer in trust 
increases the basis. 
A transfer of property is incident to a divorce if the transfer occurs within 1 year after the date on which 
the marriage ends, or if the transfer is related to the ending of the marriage. 
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  
Special rules apply to the sale or trade of property between related parties. 
Gain on sale or trade of depreciable property. Your gain from the sale or exchange of property to a 
related party may be ordinary income, rather than capital gain, if the property can be depreciated by the 
party receiving it. 
Like-kind exchanges. Generally, if you trade business or investment property for other business or 
investment property of a like kind, no gain or loss is recognized. See Like-kind exchanges earlier under 
Nontaxable Trades. 
This rule also applies to trades of property between related parties, defined next under Losses on sales 
or  trades  of  property. However, if either you or the related party disposes of the like property within 2 
years after the trade, you both must report any gain or loss not recognized on the original trade on your 
return filed for the year in which the later disposition occurs. 
Losses  on  sales  or  trades  of  property. You cannot deduct a loss on the sale or trade of property, 
other than a distribution in complete liquidation of a corporation, if the transaction is directly or indirectly 
between you and the following related parties.
1. Members of your family. This includes only your brothers and sisters, half-brothers and 
half-sisters,  spouse,  ancestors  (parents,  grandparents,  etc.),  and  lineal  descendants 
(children, grandchildren, etc.). 
2. A partnership in which you directly or indirectly own more than 50% of the capital interest 
or the profits interest.
3. A  corporation  in  which  you  directly  or  indirectly  own  more  than  50%  in  value  of  the 
outstanding stock.
4. A tax-exempt charitable or educational organization that is directly or indirectly controlled, 
in any manner or by any method, by you or by a member of your family, whether or not 
this control is legally enforceable.  

 160  •  Chapter 14: Sale of Property
Multiple property sales or trades. If you sell or trade to a related party a number of blocks of stock or 
pieces of property in a lump sum, you must figure the gain or loss separately for each block of stock or 
piece of property. The gain on each item may be taxable. However, you cannot deduct the loss on any 
item. Also, you cannot reduce gains from the sales of any of these items by losses on the sales of any of 
the other items. 
Indirect transactions. You cannot deduct your loss on the sale of stock through your broker if, under a 
prearranged plan, a related party buys the same stock you had owned. This does not apply to a trade 
between related parties through an exchange that is purely coincidental and is not prearranged. 
Property received from a related party. If you sell or trade at a gain property that you acquired from a 
related party, you recognize the gain only to the extent it is more than the loss previously disallowed to 
the related party. This rule applies only if you are the original transferee and you acquired the property 
by purchase or exchange. This rule does not apply if the related party’s loss was disallowed because of 
the wash sale rules. 
If you sell or trade at a loss property that you acquired from a related party, you cannot recognize the 
loss that was not allowed to the related party. 
Example 1
Your brother sells you stock for $7,600. His cost basis is $10,000. Your brother cannot 
deduct the loss of $2,400. Later, you sell the same stock to an unrelated party for 
$10,500, realizing a gain of $2,900. Your reportable gain is $500 – the $2,900 gain 
minus the $2,400 loss not allowed to your brother. 
Example 2
If, in Example 1, you sold the stock for $6,900 instead of $10,500, your recognized loss 
is only $700 (your $7,600 basis minus $6,900). You cannot deduct the loss that was 
not allowed to your brother.
III. CAPITAL GAINS AND LOSSES  
This  section  discusses  the  tax  treatment  of  gains  and  losses  from  different  types  of  investment 
transactions. 
Character of gain or loss. You need to classify your gains and losses as either ordinary or capital gains 
or losses. You then need to classify your capital gains and losses as either short-term or long-term. If 
you have long-term gains and losses, you must identify your 28% rate gains and losses. If you have a 
net capital gain, you must also identify any unrecaptured section 1250 gain.

 161  •  Chapter 14: Sale of Property
The correct classification and identification helps you figure the limit on capital losses and the correct tax 
on capital gains.
CAPITAL OR ORDINARY GAIN OR LOSS 
If you have a taxable gain or a deductible loss from a transaction, it may be either a capital gain or loss 
or an ordinary gain or loss, depending on the circumstances. Generally, a sale or trade of a capital asset 
(defined next) results in a capital gain or loss. A sale or trade of a noncapital asset generally results in 
ordinary gain or loss. Depending on the circumstances, a gain or loss on a sale or trade of property used 
in a trade or business may be treated as either capital or ordinary. In some situations, part of your gain or 
loss may be a capital gain or loss, and part may be an ordinary gain or loss. 
CAPITAL ASSETS 
For the most part, everything you own and use for personal purposes, pleasure, or investment is a 
capital asset. Some examples are:
• Stocks or bonds held in your personal account, 
• A home owned and used by you and your family,
• Household furnishings, 
• A car used for pleasure or commuting,
• Coin or stamp collections, 
• Gems and jewelry, and
• Gold, silver, or any other metals. 
Investment Property 
Investment property is a capital asset. Any gain or loss from its sale or trade is generally a capital gain 
or loss. 
Gold, silver, stamps, coins, gems, etc. These are capital assets except when they are held for sale by 
a dealer. Any gain or loss you have from their sale or trade generally is a capital gain or loss.
Stocks, stock rights, and bonds. All of these (including stock received as a dividend) are capital assets 
except when held for sale by a securities dealer.
Personal Use Property
Property held for personal use only, rather than for investment, is a capital asset, and you must report 
a gain from its sale as a capital gain. However, you cannot deduct a loss from selling personal use 
property. 

 162  •  Chapter 14: Sale of Property
Discounted Debt Instruments   
Treat your gain or loss on the sale, redemption, or retirement of a bond or other debt instrument originally 
issued at a discount or bought at a discount as capital gain or loss, except as explained in the following 
discussions. 
Short-term  government  obligations. Treat  gains  on  short-term  federal,  state,  or  local  government 
obligations  (other  than  tax-exempt  obligations)  as  ordinary  income  up  to  your  ratable  share  of  the 
acquisition discount. This treatment applies to obligations that have a fixed maturity date not more than 
1 year from the date of issue. Acquisition discount is the stated redemption price at maturity minus your 
basis in the obligation. 
However, do not treat these gains as income to the extent you previously included the discount in income.
Short-term  nongovernment  obligations.  Treat  gains  on  short-term  nongovernment  obligations  as 
ordinary income up to your ratable share of original issue discount (OID). This treatment applies to 
obligations that have a fixed maturity date of not more than 1 year from the date of issue. However, to 
the extent you previously included the discount in income, you do not have to include it in income again. 
Tax-exempt  state  and  local  government  bonds. If these bonds were originally issued at a discount 
before September 4, 1982, or you acquired them before March 2, 1984, treat your part of the OID as 
tax-exempt interest. To figure your gain or loss on the sale or trade of these bonds, reduce the amount 
realized by your part of the OID. 
If the bonds were issued after September 3, 1982, and acquired after March 1, 1984, increase the 
adjusted basis by your part of the OID to figure gain or loss. 
Any gain from market discount is usually taxable on disposition or redemption of tax-exempt bonds. If 
you bought the bonds before May 1, 1993, the gain from market discount is capital gain. If you bought 
the bonds after April 30, 1993, the gain is ordinary income. 
You figure the market discount by subtracting the price you paid for the bond from the sum of the original 
issue price of the bond and the amount of accumulated OID from the date of issue that represented 
interest to any earlier holders. 
A loss on the sale or other disposition of a tax-exempt state or local government bond is deductible as a 
capital loss. 
Market  discount  bonds.  If  the  debt  instrument  has  market  discount  and  you  chose  to  include  the 
discount in income as it accrued, increase your basis in the debt instrument by the accrued discount 
to figure capital gain or loss on its disposition. If you did not choose to include the discount in income 
as it accrued, you must report gain as ordinary interest income up to the instrument’s accrued market 
discount. The rest of the gain is capital gain. 
Retirement of debt instrument. Any amount that you receive on the retirement of a debt instrument is 
treated in the same way as if you had sold or traded that instrument. 

 163  •  Chapter 14: Sale of Property
Deposit in Insolvent or Bankrupt Financial Institution  
If you lose money you have on deposit in a bank, credit union, or other financial institution that becomes 
insolvent or bankrupt, you may be able to deduct your loss as a casualty or as a nonbusiness bad debt 
short-term capital loss.
Sale of Annuity 
The part of any gain on the sale of an annuity contract before its maturity date that is based on interest 
accumulated on the contract is ordinary income. 
LOSSES ON SECTION 1244 (SMALL BUSINESS STOCK) 
Subject to the ordinary loss limit, you can deduct as an ordinary loss, rather than as a capital loss, your 
loss on the sale, trade, or worthlessness of section 1244 stock. Report an ordinary loss from the sale, 
exchange, or worthlessness of section 1244 stock on Form 4797, line 10. However, if the total loss is 
more than the maximum amount that can be treated as an ordinary loss, also report the transaction on 
Form 8949. See the instructions for Forms 4797 and 8949.
Any gain on section 1244 stock is a capital gain if the stock is a capital asset in your hands. Report the 
gain on Form 8949.
HOLDING PERIOD  
If you sold or traded investment property, you must determine your holding period for the property. Your 
holding period determines whether any capital gain or loss was a short-term or long-term capital gain or 
loss. 
Long term or short term. If you hold investment property more than 1 year, any capital gain or loss is a 
long-term capital gain or loss. If you hold the property 1 year or less, any capital gain or loss is a short-
term capital gain or loss. 
To determine how long you held the investment property, begin counting on the date after the day you 
acquired the property. The day you disposed of the property is part of your holding period.
Example
If you bought investment property on January 31, 2023, and sold it on January 29, 
2024, your holding period is not more than 1 year and you have a short-term capital 
gain or loss. If you sold it on February 6, 2024, your holding period is more than 1 year 
and you will have a long-term capital gain or loss.
Securities traded on established market. For securities traded on an established securities market, 
your holding period begins the day after the trade date you bought the securities, and ends on the trade 
date you sold them. 

 164  •  Chapter 14: Sale of Property
Example
You are a cash method, calendar year taxpayer. You sold stock at a gain on December 
30, 2024. According to the rules of the stock exchange, the sale was closed by delivery 
of the stock and payment of the sale price in January 2025. Report your gain on your 
2024 return, even though you received the payment in 2025. The gain is long term or 
short term depending on whether you held the stock more than 1 year. Your holding 
period ended on December 30. 
Nontaxable  trades.  If  you  acquire  investment  property  in  a  trade  for  other  investment  property  and  
your basis for the new property is determined, in whole or in part, by your basis in the old property, your 
holding period for the new property begins on the day following the date you acquired the old property. 
Property received as a gift. If you receive a gift of property and your basis is determined by the donor’s 
adjusted basis, your holding period is considered to have started on the same day the donor’s holding 
period started. 
If your basis is determined by the fair market value of the property, your holding period starts on the day 
after the date of the gift. 
Inherited property. Generally, if you inherit investment property, your capital gain or loss on any later 
disposition of that property is treated as a long-term capital gain or loss. This is true regardless of how 
long you actually held the property. 
Real property bought. To figure how long you have held real property bought under an unconditional 
contract, begin counting on the day after you received title to it or on the day after you took possession 
of it and assumed the burdens and privileges of ownership, whichever happened first. However, taking 
delivery  or  possession  of  real  property  under  an  option  agreement  is  not  enough  to  start  the  holding  
period. The holding period cannot start until there is an actual contract of sale. The holding period of the 
seller cannot end before that time. 
Stock dividends. The holding period for stock you received as a taxable stock dividend begins on the 
date of distribution. 
The holding period for new stock you received as a nontaxable stock dividend begins on the same day 
as the holding period of the old stock. This rule also applies to stock acquired in a “spin-off,” which is a 
distribution of stock or securities in a controlled corporation. 
Nontaxable stock rights. Your holding period for nontaxable stock rights begins on the same day as 
the holding period of the underlying stock. The holding period for stock acquired through the exercise of 
stock rights begins on the date the right was exercised.

 165  •  Chapter 14: Sale of Property
NONBUSINESS BAD DEBTS 
If someone owes you money that you cannot collect, you have a bad debt. You may be able to deduct 
the amount owed to you when you figure your tax for the year the debt becomes worthless. A debt must 
be genuine for you to deduct a loss. A debt is genuine if it arises from a debtor-creditor relationship 
based on a valid and enforceable obligation to repay a fixed or determinable sum of money. 
Generally, nonbusiness bad debts are bad debts that you did not get in the course of operating your 
trade or business and are deductible as short-term capital losses. To be deductible, nonbusiness bad 
debts must be totally worthless. You cannot deduct a partly worthless nonbusiness debt. 
Basis in bad debt required. To deduct a bad debt, you must have a basis in it – that is, you must have 
already included the amount in your income or loaned out your cash. For example, you cannot claim 
a bad debt deduction for court-ordered child support not paid to you by your former spouse. If you are 
a cash method taxpayer (as most individuals are), you generally cannot take a bad debt deduction for 
unpaid salaries, wages, rents, fees, interest, dividends, and similar items.
WASH SALES
You cannot deduct losses from sales or trades of stock or securities in a wash sale.
A wash sale occurs when you sell or trade stock or securities at a loss and within 30 days before or after 
the sale you:
1. Buy substantially identical stock or securities,
2. Acquire substantially identical stock or securities in a fully taxable trade, 
3. Acquire a contract or option to buy substantially identical stock or securities, or
4. Acquire substantially identical stock for your individual retirement account (IRA) or Roth 
IRA.
If your loss was disallowed because of the wash sale rules, add the disallowed loss to the cost of the 
new stock or securities (except (4) above). The result is your basis in the new stock or securities. This 
adjustment postpones the loss deduction until the disposition of the new stock or securities. Your holding 
period for the new stock or securities includes the holding period of the stock or securities sold.

CHAPTER 14: SOLUTIONS AND SUGGESTED RESPONSES
Below are the solutions and suggested responses for the questions on the previous page(s). If you 
choose an incorrect answer, you should review the pages as indicated for each question to ensure 
comprehension of the material.
1.A. Incorrect. Transfers within three months of the final divorce date is not correct.
B. CORRECT. The transfer of property is incident to a divorce if the transfer occurs within 
one year after the date on which the marriage ends, or if the transfer is related to the 
ending of the marriage. This carryover basis rule applies whether the adjusted basis of 
the transferred property is less than, equal to, or greater than either its fair market value 
at the time of transfer or any consideration paid by the recipient
C. Incorrect. Transfers within two years of the final divorce date is a longer period of time 
than allowed.
D. Incorrect. Transfers within three years of the final divorce date is a longer period of time 
than allowed.
(See pages 161 to 162 of the course material.)
2.A. Incorrect. To be deductible, a nonbusiness bad debt must be totally worthless in order 
to make a claim.
B. Incorrect. A nonbusiness bad debt must originally have had a cost basis.
C. Incorrect. To be a nonbusiness deduction, it cannot arise from the operation of a trade 
or business.
D. CORRECT. A limit to the amount of debt is not a condition required for the deductibility of  
a nonbusiness bad debt. There is not a fixed amount requirement.

CHAPTER 15: SELLING YOUR HOME
Chapter Objective
After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• Identify the special tax rules related to selling your home.
I.   IMPORTANT INFORMATION
Exclusion  of  forgiven  mortgage  debt  from  income.  The  exclusion  of  income  for  mortgage  debt 
canceled or forgiven has been extended through 2025.
II. INTRODUCTION 
This chapter explains the tax rules that apply when you sell your main home. In most cases, your main 
home is the one in which you live most of the time. 
If you sold your main home in 2024, you may be able to exclude from income any gain up to a limit of 
$250,000 ($500,000 on a joint return in most cases). See Excluding the Gain, later. Generally, if you can 
exclude all of the gain, you do not need to report the sale on your tax return.
If you have gain that cannot be excluded, it is taxable. Report it on Form 8949 and Schedule D (Form 
1040). You may also have to complete Form 4797, Sales of Business Property. See Reporting the Sale, 
later.
If you have a loss on the sale, you cannot deduct it on your return. However, you may need to report it.
The following are main topics in this chapter.
• Figuring gain or loss.
• Basis.
• Excluding the gain.
• Ownership and use tests.
• Reporting the sale.
III. MAIN HOME 
Usually, the home you live in most of the time is your main home and can be a: 
• House, 

 169  •  Chapter 15: Selling Your Home
• Houseboat, 
• Mobile home, 
• Cooperative apartment, or 
• Condominium. 
To exclude gain under the rules of this chapter, you generally must have owned and lived in the property 
as your main home for at least 2 years during the 5-year period ending on the date of sale. 
Land. If you sell the land on which your main home is located, but not the house itself, you cannot 
exclude any gain you have from the sale of the land. However, if you sell vacant land used as part of 
your main home and that is adjacent to it, you may be able to exclude the gain from the sale under 
certain circumstances.
Example
You buy a piece of land and move your main home to it. Then you sell the land on which 
your main home was located. This sale is not considered a sale of your main home, and 
you cannot exclude any gain on the sale of the land. 
More than one home. If you have more than one home, you can exclude gain only from the sale of your 
main home. You must include in income the gain from the sale of any other home. If you have two homes 
and live in both of them, your main home is ordinarily the one you live in most of the time during the year. 
Example 1
You own two homes, one in New York and one in Florida. From 2020 through 2024, 
you live in the New York home for 7 months and in the Florida residence for 5 months 
of each year. In the absence of facts and circumstances indicating otherwise, the New 
York home is your main home. You would be eligible to exclude the gain from the sale 
of the New York home but not of the Florida home in 2024. 
 
Example 2
 
You own a house, but you live in another house that you rent. The rented house is your 
main home.

 170  •  Chapter 15: Selling Your Home
Property used partly as your main home. If you use only part of the property as your main home, the 
rules discussed in this chapter apply only to the gain or loss on the sale of that part of the property. For 
details, see Business Use or Rental of Home, later.
I V.  FIGURING GAIN OR LOSS 
To figure the gain or loss on the sale of your main home, you must know the selling price, the amount 
realized, and the adjusted basis. Subtract the adjusted basis from the amount realized to get your gain 
or loss. 
SELLING PRICE 
The selling price is the total amount you receive for your home. It includes money and the fair market 
value of any other property or any services you receive and all notes, mortgages, or other debts assumed 
by the buyer as part of the sale.
Payment  by  employer. You may have to sell your home because of a job transfer. If your employer 
pays you for a loss on the sale or for your selling expenses, do not include the payment as part of the 
selling price. Your employer will include it in box 1 of your Form W-2 and you will include it in your gross 
income as wages on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 1. 
Option to buy. If you grant an option to buy your home and the option is exercised, add the amount you 
receive for the option to the selling price of your home. If the option is not exercised, you must report 
the amount as ordinary income in the year the option expires. Report this amount on Schedule 1 (Form 
1040), line 8z. 
Form  1099-S.  If you received Form 1099-S, Proceeds  From  Real  Estate  Transactions, box 2 (Gross 
proceeds) should show the total amount you received for your home. 
However, box 2 will not include the fair market value of any property other than cash or notes, or any 
services, you received or will receive. Instead, box 4 will be checked to indicate your receipt (or expected 
receipt) of these items. 
AMOUNT REALIZED 
The amount realized is the selling price minus selling expenses. 
Selling expenses. Selling expenses include: 
• Commissions,
• Advertising fees,
• Legal fees, and
• Loan charges paid by the seller, such as loan placement fees or “points.”

 171  •  Chapter 15: Selling Your Home
ADJUSTED BASIS 
While you owned your home, you may have made adjustments (increases or decreases) to the basis. 
This adjusted basis must be determined before you can figure gain or loss on the sale of your home. For 
information on how to figure your home’s adjusted basis, see Determining Basis later. 
AMOUNT OF GAIN OR LOSS 
To figure the amount of gain or loss, compare the amount realized to the adjusted basis. 
Gain on sale. If the amount realized is more than the adjusted basis, the difference is a gain and, except 
for any part you can exclude, in most cases is taxable. 
Loss on sale. If the amount realized is less than the adjusted basis, the difference is a loss. A loss on 
the sale of your main home cannot be deducted. 
Jointly owned home. If you and your spouse sell your jointly owned home and file a joint return, you 
figure your gain or loss as one taxpayer. 
Separate returns. If you file separate returns, each of you must figure your own gain or loss according 
to your ownership interest in the home. Your ownership interest is determined by state law. 
Joint  owners  not  married.  If  you  and  a  joint  owner  other  than  your  spouse  sell  your  jointly  owned  
home, each of you must figure your own gain or loss according to your ownership interest in the home. 
Each of you applies the rules discussed in this chapter on an individual basis. 
DISPOSITIONS OTHER THAN SALES
Trading (exchanging) homes. If you trade your old home for another home, treat the trade as a sale 
and a purchase. 
Example
You owned and lived in a home that had an adjusted basis of $41,000. A real estate 
dealer accepted your old home as a trade-in and allowed you $50,000 toward a new 
home priced at $80,000. This is treated as a sale of your old home for $50,000 with a 
gain of $9,000 ($50,000 - $41,000).
If the dealer had allowed you $27,000 and assumed your unpaid mortgage of $23,000 
on your old home, your sales price would still be $50,000 (the $27,000 trade-in allowed 
plus the $23,000 mortgage assumed). 
Foreclosure or repossession. If your home was foreclosed on or repossessed, you have a disposition. 
Transfer to spouse. If you transfer your home to your spouse, or to your former spouse incident to your 
divorce, you generally have no gain or loss. This is true even if you receive cash or other consideration 
for the home. As a result, the rules in this chapter do not apply. 

 172  •  Chapter 15: Selling Your Home
DETERMINING BASIS 
You need to know your basis in your home to determine any gain or loss when you sell it. Your basis in 
your home is determined by how you got the home. Generally, your basis is its cost if you bought it or 
built it. If you got it in some other way (inheritance, gift, etc.), your basis is generally either its fair market 
value when you received it or the adjusted basis of the previous owner. 
While you owned your home, you may have made adjustments (increases or decreases) to your home’s 
basis. The result of these adjustments is your home’s adjusted basis, which is used to figure gain or loss 
on the sale of your home. See Adjusted Basis, later. 
Cost as Basis 
The cost of property is the amount you pay for it in cash, debt obligations, other property, or services. 
Purchase. If you bought your home, your basis is its cost to you. This includes the purchase price and 
certain settlement or closing costs. In most cases, your purchase price includes your down payment and 
any debt, such as a first or second mortgage or notes you gave the seller in payment for the home. If you 
build, or contract to build, a new home, your purchase price can include costs of construction.
Settlement fees or closing costs. When you bought your home, you may have paid settlement fees or 
closing costs in addition to the contract price of the property. You can include in your basis the settlement 
fees and closing costs you paid for buying the home, but not the fees and costs for getting a mortgage 
loan. A fee paid for buying the home is any fee you would have had to pay even if you paid cash for the 
home (that is without the need for financing). 
Adjusted Basis 
Adjusted basis is your cost or other basis increased or decreased by certain amounts. 
Increases to basis. These include any:  
• Additions and other improvements that have a useful life of more than 1 year. 
• Special assessments for local improvements.
• Amounts you spent after a casualty to restore damaged property.  
Improvements. These add to the value of your home, prolong its useful life, or adapt it to new uses. You 
add the cost of additions and other improvements to the basis of your property.
Example
Putting a recreation room or another bathroom in your unfinished basement, putting 
up a new fence, putting in new plumbing or wiring, putting on a new roof, or paving 
your unpaved driveway are improvements. An addition to your house, such as a new 
deck, a sunroom, or a garage, is also an improvement. 

 173  •  Chapter 15: Selling Your Home
Repairs. These maintain your home in good condition but do not add to its value or prolong its life. You 
do not add their cost to the basis of your property.
Example
 
Repainting your house inside or outside, fixing your gutters or floors, repairing leaks or 
plastering, and replacing broken window panes are examples of repairs. 
Decreases to basis. These include the following:  
• The amount of qualified principal residence indebtedness that has been excluded from 
income for discharges before January 1, 2026, or was subject to an arrangement that 
was entered into and evidenced in writing before January 1, 2026.
• Some or all of the cancellation of debt income that was excluded due to your bankruptcy 
or insolvency.
• Gain you postponed from the sale of a previous home before May 7, 1997.
• Deductible casualty losses.
• Insurance payments you received or expect to receive for casualty losses.
• Payments you received for granting an easement or right-of-way.
• Depreciation allowed or allowable if you used your home for business or rental purposes.
• Adoption credit you claimed for improvements added to the basis of your home.
• Nontaxable payments from an adoption assistance program of your employer that you 
used for improvements you added to the basis of your home.
• Energy conservation subsidy excluded from your gross income because you received 
it  (directly  or  indirectly)  from  a  public  utility  after  1992  to  buy  or  install  any  energy 
conservation measure. An energy conservation measure is an installation or modification 
that is primarily designed either to reduce consumption of electricity or natural gas or to 
improve the management of energy demand for a home.
• General sales taxes (beginning in 2004) claimed as an itemized deduction on Schedule 
A  (Form  1040)  that  were  imposed  on  the  purchase  of  personal  property,  such  as  a 
houseboat used as your home or a mobile home.

 174  •  Chapter 15: Selling Your Home
V.   EXCLUDING THE GAIN 
You may qualify to exclude from your income all or part of any gain from the sale of your main home. 
This means that, if you qualify, you will not have to pay tax on the gain up to the limit described under 
Maximum Exclusion, next. To qualify, you must meet the ownership and use tests described later. 
You can choose not to take the exclusion. In that case, you must include in gross income your entire 
gain in the year of sale. 
MAXIMUM EXCLUSION 
You can exclude up to $250,000 of the gain (other than gain allocated to periods of nonqualified use) on 
the sale of your main home if all of the following are true.
1. You meet the ownership test. 
2. You meet the use test. 
3. During the 2-year period ending on the date of the sale, you did not exclude gain from the 
sale of another home. 
You may be able to exclude up to $500,000 of the gain (other than gain allocated to periods of nonqualified 
use) on the sale of your main home if you are married and file a joint return and meet the requirements 
listed in the discussion of the special rules for joint returns, later, under Married Persons.
OWNERSHIP AND USE TESTS 
To claim the exclusion, you must meet the ownership and use tests. This means that during the 5-year 
period ending on the date of the sale, you must have:  
1. Owned the home for at least 2 years (the ownership test), and 
2. Lived in the home as your main home for at least 2 years (the use test).  
Exception
If you owned and lived in the property as your main home for less than 2 years, you can 
still claim an exclusion in some cases. However, the maximum amount you may be able 
to exclude will be reduced. See Reduced Maximum Exclusion, later.
Period of Ownership and Use 
The required 2 years of ownership and use during the 5-year period ending on the date of the sale do 
not have to be continuous, nor do they both have to occur at the same time. 

 175  •  Chapter 15: Selling Your Home
You  meet  the  tests  if  you  can  show  that  you  owned  and  lived  in  the  property  as  your  main  home  for  
either 24 full months or 730 days (365 × 2) during the 5-year period ending on the date of sale. 
Temporary absence. Short temporary absences for vacations or other seasonal absences, even if you 
rent the property during the absences, are counted as periods of use. 
Example
Professor Paul Beard, who is single, bought and moved into a house on August 19, 
2021. He lived in it as his main home continuously until January 5, 2023, when he went 
abroad for a 1-year sabbatical leave. On February 5, 2024, 1 month after returning from 
leave, he sold the house at a gain.
Because his leave was not a short temporary absence, he cannot include the period of 
leave to meet the 2-year use test. He cannot exclude any part of his gain, because he did 
not use the residence for the required 2 years. 
Ownership and use tests met at different times. You can meet the ownership and use tests during 
different 2-year periods. However, you must meet both tests during the 5-year period ending on the date 
of the sale. 
Example
Beginning in 2013, Helen Jones lived in a rented apartment. The apartment building 
was  later  converted  to  condominiums,  and  she  bought  her  same  apartment  on 
December 2, 2021. In 2022, Helen became ill and on April 14 of that year she moved 
to her daughter’s home. On July 7, 2024, while still living in her daughter’s home, she 
sold her condominium.
Helen can exclude gain on the sale of her condominium because she met the ownership 
and use tests during the 5-year period from July 8, 2019 to July 7, 2024 (more than 2 
years). She owned her condominium from December 2, 2021, to July 7, 2024 (over 2 
years). She lived in the property from July 8, 2019 (the beginning of the 5-year period), 
to April 14, 2022 (over 2 years).
The time Helen lived in her daughter’s home during the 5-year period can be counted 
toward her period of ownership, and the time she lived in her rented apartment during 
the 5-year period can be counted toward her period of use.
Cooperative apartment. If you sold stock in a cooperative housing corporation, the ownership and use 
tests are met if, during the 5-year period ending on the date of sale, you:  
1. Owned the stock for at least 2 years, and 

 176  •  Chapter 15: Selling Your Home
2. Lived in the house or apartment that the stock entitles you to occupy as your main home 
for at least 2 years.  
Exception for individuals with a disability. There is an exception to the use test if:  
1. You become physically or mentally unable to care for yourself, and 
2. You owned and lived in your home as your main home for a total of at least 1 year during 
the 5-year period before the sale of your home. 
Under this exception, you are considered to live in your home during any time within the 5-year period 
that you own the home and live in a facility (including a nursing home) licensed by a state or political 
subdivision to care for persons in your condition. 
If you meet this exception to the use test, you still have to meet the 2-out-of-5-year ownership test to 
claim the exclusion. 
Previous  home  destroyed  or  condemned. For the ownership and use tests, you add the time you 
owned and lived in a previous home that was destroyed or condemned to the time you owned and lived 
in the home on which you wish to exclude gain. This rule applies if any part of the basis of the home you 
sold depended on the basis of the destroyed or condemned home. Otherwise, you must have owned 
and lived in the same home for 2 of the 5 years before the sale to qualify for the exclusion. 
Married Persons 
If you and your spouse file a joint return for the year of sale and one spouse meets the ownership and 
use test, you can exclude up to $250,000 of the gain. (But see Special rules for joint returns, next.) 
Special rules for joint returns. You can exclude up to $500,000 of the gain on the sale of your main 
home if all of the following are true.
• You are married and file a joint return for the year.
• Either you or your spouse meets the ownership test.
• Both you and your spouse meet the use test.
• During the 2-year period ending on the date of the sale, neither you nor your spouse 
excluded gain from the sale of another home.
If either spouse does not satisfy all these requirements, the maximum exclusion that can be claimed by 
the couple is the total of the maximum exclusions that each spouse would qualify for if not married and 
the amounts were figured separately. For this purpose, each spouse is treated as owning the property 
during the period that either spouse owned the property.

 177  •  Chapter 15: Selling Your Home
Example 1
One spouse sells a home. Emily sells her home in June 2024 for a gain of $300,000. 
She marries Jamie later in the year. She meets the ownership and use tests, but Jamie 
does not. She can exclude up to $250,000 of gain on a separate or joint return for 2024. 
The $500,000 maximum exclusion for certain joint filers does not apply because Jamie 
does not meet the use test.
 
Example 2
Each spouse sells a home. The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that Jamie 
also sells a home in 2024 for a gain of $200,000 before he marries Emily. He meets 
the ownership and use tests on his home, but Emily does not. Emily can exclude up 
to $250,000 of gain and Jamie can exclude $200,000 of the gain on the respective 
sales of their individual homes. However, Emily cannot use Jamie’s unused exclusion 
to exclude more than $250,000 of gain. Therefore, Emily and Jamie must recognize 
$50,000 of gain on the sale of Emily’s home. The $500,000 maximum exclusion for 
certain joint returns does not apply because Emily and Jamie do not jointly meet the 
use test for the same home.
Home transferred from spouse. If your home was transferred to you by your spouse (or former spouse 
if the transfer was incident to divorce), you are considered to have owned it during any period of time 
when your spouse owned it. 
Use of home after divorce. You are considered to have used property as your main home during any 
period when:  
1. You owned it, and 
2. Your  spouse  or  former  spouse  is  allowed  to  live  in  it  under  a  divorce  or  separation  
instrument and uses it as his or her main home.
REDUCED MAXIMUM EXCLUSION
If you fail to meet the requirements to qualify for the $250,000 or $500,000 exclusion, you may still 
qualify for a reduced exclusion. This applies to those who:
• Fail to meet the ownership and use tests, or
• Have used the exclusion within 2 years of selling their current home.
In both cases, to qualify for a reduced exclusion, the sale of your main home must be due to one of the 
following reasons.

 178  •  Chapter 15: Selling Your Home
• A change in place of employment.
• Health.
• Unforeseen circumstances.
Unforeseen  circumstances. The sale of your main home is because of an unforeseen circumstance 
if your primary reason for the sale is the occurrence of an event that you could not reasonably have 
anticipated before buying and occupying your main home.
VI. BUSINESS USE OR RENTAL OF HOME 
You may be able to exclude your gain from the sale of a home that you have used for business or to 
produce rental income. But you must meet the ownership and use tests.
Example 1
On May 24, 2018, Amy, who is single for all years in this example, bought a house. 
She moved in on that date and lived in it until May 31, 2020, when she moved out of 
the house and put it up for rent. The house was rented from June 1, 2020 to March 31, 
2022. Amy claimed depreciation deductions in 2020 through 2022 totaling $10,000. 
Amy moved back into the house on April 1, 2022, and lived there until she sold it on 
January 28, 2024 for a gain of $200,000. During the 5-year period ending on the date 
of the sale (January 29, 2019 - January 28, 2024), Amy owned and lived in the house 
for more than 2 years as shown in the table below.
Five Year PeriodUsed as HomeUsed as Rental
1/29/19 – 5/31/2016 months
6/1/20 – 3/31/2222 months
4/1/22 – 1/28/2422 months________
38 months22 months
Next, Amy must figure how much of her gain is allocated to qualified use.
During the period Amy owned the house (2,076 days), her period of nonqualified use 
was 670 days. Amy divides 670 by 2,076 and obtains a decimal (rounded to at least three 
decimal places) of 0.323. To figure her gain attributable to the period of nonqualified 
use, she multiplies $190,000 (the gain not attributable to the $10,000 depreciation 
deduction) by 0.323. Because the gain attributable to periods of nonqualified use is 
$61,370, Amy can exclude $128,630 of her gain.

 179  •  Chapter 15: Selling Your Home
Example 2
William owned and used a house as his main home from 2018 through 2021. On 
January 1, 2022, he moved to another state. He rented his house from that date until 
April 29, 2024, when he sold it. During the 5-year period ending on the date of sale 
(April 30, 2019 - April 29, 2024), William owned and lived in the house for more than 2 
years. He must report the sale on Form 4797 because it was rental property at the time 
of sale. Because the period of nonqualified use does not include any part of the 5-year 
period after the last day William lived in the house, he has no period of nonqualified 
use. Because he met the ownership and use tests, he can exclude gain up to $250,000. 
However, he cannot exclude the part of the gain equal to the depreciation he claimed or 
could have claimed for renting the house, as explained next. 
Depreciation after May 6, 1997. If you were entitled to take depreciation deductions because you used 
your home for business purposes or as rental property, you cannot exclude the part of your gain equal 
to any depreciation allowed as a deduction for periods after May 6, 1997. If you can show by adequate 
records or other evidence that the depreciation deduction allowed was less than the amount allowable, 
then you may limit the amount of gain recognized to the depreciation allowed. 
VII. REPORTING THE SALE 
Do not report the 2024 sale of your main home on your tax return unless: 
• You have a gain and you do not qualify to exclude all of it, 
• You have a gain and you choose not to exclude it, or
• You received Form 1099-S. 
If any of these conditions apply, report the entire gain. For details on how to report the gain, see the 
Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040) and the Instructions for Form 8949.
If you used the home for business or to produce rental income, you may have to use Form 4797 to report 
the sale of the business or rental part (or the sale of the entire property if used entirely for business or 
rental). 
Installment  sale.  Some  sales  are  made  under  arrangements  that  provide  for  part  or  all  of  the  selling  
price to be paid in a later year. These sales are called “installment sales.” If you finance the buyer’s 
purchase of your home yourself, instead of having the buyer get a loan or mortgage from a bank, you 
probably have an installment sale. You may be able to report the part of the gain you cannot exclude on 
the installment basis. 
Use Form 6252, Installment  Sale  Income, to report the sale. Enter your exclusion on line 15 of Form 
6252.

CHAPTER 16: REPORTING GAINS AND LOSSES
Chapter Objective
After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• Recall the capital gain rates for the current year.
I.   IMPORTANT INFORMATION
Reporting  of  deferred  gain  from  sale  or  exchange  of  QOF  investment.  If  you  sold  or  exchanged  
your investment in a QOF and you need to report the gain previously deferred, you will  need to report 
the gain on Form 8949. See the instructions for Form 8949 for more information.
II. INTRODUCTION 
This  chapter  discusses  how  to  report  capital  gains  and  losses  from  sales, exchanges,  and  other 
dispositions of investment property on Form 8949 and Schedule D (Form 1040). The discussion includes: 
• How to report short-term gains and losses, 
• How to report long-term gains and losses, 
• How to figure capital loss carryovers, and
• How to figure your tax on a net capital gain. 
III. REPORTING CAPITAL GAINS AND LOSSES 
Generally, report capital gains and losses on Form 8949. Complete Form 8949 before you complete line 
1b, 2, 3, 8b, 9, or 10 of Schedule D (Form 1040).
Use Form 8949 to report:
• The sale or exchange of a capital asset not reported on another form or schedule,
• Gains  from  involuntary  conversions  (other  than  from  casualty  or  theft)  of  capital  assets  
not held for business or profit, 
• Nonbusiness bad debts, and
• Securities that become worthless.

 183  •  Chapter 16: Reporting Gains and Losses
Use Schedule D (Form 1040) to report:
• Overall gain or loss from transactions reported on Form 8949;
• Certain transactions you do not have to report on Form 8949;
• Gain from Form 2439 or 6252 or Part I of Form 4797;
• Gain or loss from Form 4684, 6781, or 8824;
• Gain or loss from a partnership, S corporation, estate, or trust;
• Capital gain distributions not reported directly on your Form 1040 or 1040-SR; and
• Capital loss carryover from the previous year to the current year.
On Form 8949, enter all sales and exchanges of capital assets, including stocks, bonds, etc., and real 
estate (if not reported on Form 4684, 4797, 6252, 6781, 8824 or line 1a or 8a of Schedule D (Form 1040)). 
Include these transactions even if you did not receive a Form 1099-B or 1099-S for the transaction. 
Report  short-term  gains  or  losses  in  Part  I.  Report  long-term  gains  or  losses  in  Part  II.  Use  as  many  
Forms 8949 as you need.
Passive activity gains and losses. If you have gains or losses from a passive activity, you may also 
have to report them on Form 8582. In some cases, the loss may be limited under the passive activity 
rules. Refer to Form 8582 and its instructions for more information about reporting capital gains and 
losses from a passive activity.
Sale  expenses. On Form 8949, include in column (g) any expense of sale, such as broker’s fees, 
commissions, state and local transfer taxes, and option premiums, unless you reported the net sales 
price in column (d). If you include an expense of sale in column (g), enter “E” in column (f). 
For more information about adjustments to basis, see chapter 13. 
Short-term gains and losses. Capital gain or loss on the sale or trade of investment property held 1 
year or less is a short-term capital gain or loss. You report it in Part I of Form 8949.
You combine your share of short-term capital gains or losses from partnerships, S corporations, estates, 
and trusts, and any short-term capital loss carryover, with your other short-term capital gains and losses 
to figure your net short-term capital gain or loss on Schedule D (Form 1040), line 7. 
Long-term gains and losses. A capital gain or loss on the sale or trade of property held more than 1 
year is a long-term capital gain or loss. You report it in Part II of Form 8949.

 184  •  Chapter 16: Reporting Gains and Losses
You also report the following in Part II of Schedule D (Form 1040):  
1. Undistributed long-term capital gains from a mutual fund (or other regulated investment 
company) or real estate investment trust (REIT), 
2. Your share of long-term capital gains or losses from partnerships, S corporations, estates, 
and trusts, 
3. All capital gain distributions from mutual funds and REITs not reported directly on Form 
1040 or 1040-SR, line 7, and 
4. Long-term capital loss carryovers. 
The result after combining these items with your other long-term capital gains and losses is your net 
long-term capital gain or loss on Schedule D (Form 1040), line 15. 
CAPITAL LOSSES 
If your capital losses are more than your capital gains, you can claim a capital loss deduction. Report the 
deduction on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 7, in parentheses. 
Limit on deduction. Your allowable capital loss deduction, figured on Schedule D (Form 1040), is the 
lesser of:  
1. $3,000 ($1,500 if you are married and file a separate return), or 
2. Your total net loss as shown on Schedule D (Form 1040), line 16.  
You can use your total net loss to reduce your income dollar for dollar, up to the $3,000 limit. 
Capital  loss  carryover.  If you have a total net loss on Schedule D (Form 1040), line 16 that is more 
than the yearly limit on capital loss deductions, you can carry over the unused part to the next year and 
treat it as if you had incurred it in that next year. If part of the loss is still unused, you can carry it over to 
later years until it is completely used up. 
When you figure the amount of any capital loss carryover to the next year, you must take the current 
year’s allowable deduction into account, whether or not you claimed it, and whether or not you filed a 
return for the current year. 
When you carry over a loss, it remains long term or short term. A long-term capital loss you carry over to 
the next tax year will reduce that year’s long-term capital gains before it reduces that year’s short-term 
capital gains. 
Figuring your carryover. The amount of your capital loss carryover is the amount of your total net loss 
that is more than the lesser of:  
1. Your allowable capital loss deduction for the year, or 
2. Your taxable income increased by your allowable capital loss deduction for the year. 

 185  •  Chapter 16: Reporting Gains and Losses
If your deductions are more than your gross income for the tax year, use your negative taxable income in 
computing the amount in item (2). 
Complete the Capital Loss Carryover Worksheet in the Schedule D (Form 1040) instructions to determine 
the part of your capital losses that you can carry over. 
Example
Bob and Gloria sold securities in 2024. The sales resulted in a capital loss of $7,000. 
They had no other capital transactions. Their taxable income was $26,000. On their 
joint 2024 return, they can deduct $3,000. The unused part of the loss, $4,000 ($7,000 
- $3,000), can be carried over to 2025.
If their capital loss had been $2,000, their capital loss deduction would have been 
$2,000. They would have no carryover. 
Use short-term losses first. When you figure your capital loss carryover, use your short-term capital 
losses first, even if you incurred them after a long-term capital loss. If you have not reached the limit on 
the capital loss deduction after using short-term losses, use the long-term losses until you reach the 
limit. 
Decedent’s  capital  loss. A capital loss sustained by a decedent  during  his  or  her  last  tax  year  (or  
carried over to that year from an earlier year) can be deducted only on the final income tax return filed for 
the decedent. The capital loss limits discussed earlier still apply in this situation. The decedent’s estate 
cannot deduct any of the loss or carry it over to following years. 
Joint  and  separate  returns.  If you and your spouse once filed separate returns and are now filing a 
joint return, combine your separate capital loss carryovers. However, if you and your spouse once filed 
a joint return and are now filing separate returns, any capital loss carryover from the joint return can be 
deducted only on the return of the person who actually had the loss. 
CAPITAL GAIN TAX RATES 
The tax rates that apply to a net capital gain are generally lower than the tax rates that apply to other 
income. These lower rates are called the maximum capital gain rates. 
The term “net capital gain” means the amount by which your net long-term capital gain for the year is 
more than your net short-term capital loss.
For 2024, the maximum capital gain rates are 0%, 15%, 20%, 25%, or 28%. 
Investment  interest  deducted.  If  you  claim  a  deduction  for  investment  interest,  you  may  have  to 
reduce the amount of your net capital gain that is eligible for the capital gain tax rates. Reduce it by the 
amount of the net capital gain you choose to include in investment income when figuring the limit on your 
investment interest deduction. This is done on the Schedule D Tax Worksheet or the Qualified Dividends 
and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet.

After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• Recall  the  thresholds,  requirements,  and  additional  taxes  related  to  individual  retirement 
arrangements.
I.   WHAT’S NEW
Traditional IRA contribution and deduction limit. The contribution limit to your traditional IRA for 2024 
will be the smaller of the following amounts:
• $7,000, or
• Your taxable compensation for the year.
If you were age 50 or older before 2025, the most that can be contributed to your traditional IRA for 2024 
will be the smaller of the following amounts:
• $8,000, or
• Your taxable compensation for the year.
Roth IRA contribution limit. If contributions on your behalf are made only to Roth IRAs, your contribution 
limit for 2024 will generally be the lesser of:
• $7,000, or
• Your taxable compensation for the year.
If you were age 50 or older before 2025 and contributions on your behalf were made only to Roth IRAs, 
your contribution limit for 2024 will generally be the lesser of:
• $8,000, or
• Your taxable compensation for the year.
However, if your modified adjusted gross income (AGI) is above a certain amount, your contribution limit 
may be reduced.
Modified AGI limit for traditional IRA contributions increased. For 2024, if you were covered by a 
retirement plan at work, your deduction for contributions to a traditional IRA is reduced (phased out) if 
your modified adjusted gross income (AGI) is:

 192  •  Chapter 17: Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)
• More than $123,000 but less than $143,000 for a married couple filing a joint return or a 
qualifying widow(er),
• More than $77,000 but less than $87,000 for a single individual or head of household, or
• Less than $10,000 for a married individual filing a separate return.
If you either lived with your spouse or file a joint return, and your spouse was covered by a retirement 
plan at work, but you were not, your deduction is phased out if your AGI is more than $230,000 but 
less than $240,000. If your AGI is $240,000 or more, you cannot take a deduction for contributions to a 
traditional IRA.
Modified AGI limit for Roth contributions. For  2024,  your  Roth  IRA  contribution  limit  is  reduced 
(phased out) in the following situations.
• Your filing status is married filing jointly or qualifying widow(er) and your modified AGI 
is at least $230,000. You cannot make a Roth IRA contribution if your modified AGI is 
$240,000 or more.
• Your filing status is single, head of household, or married filing separately and you did not 
live with your spouse at any time in 2024, and your modified AGI is at least $146,000. You 
cannot make a Roth IRA contribution if your modified AGI is $161,000 or more.
• Your filing  status  is  married  filing  separately,  you  lived  with  your  spouse  at  any  time 
during the year, and your modified AGI is more than -0-. You cannot make a Roth IRA 
contribution if your modified AGI is $10,000 or more.
II. IMPORTANT REMINDERS 
SECURE ACT AND SECURE ACT 2.0
Among the provisions of the SECURE Act, for tax years beginning after 2019, the age restriction on 
contributions to traditional IRAs was repealed, and the age requirement for taking RMDs was increased 
to 72 (from 70½). Subsequently, among the provisions of the SECURE Act 2.0, signed in December 
2022, the age requirement for taking RMDs was increased to 73 for individuals who had not reached 
age 72 before January 1, 2023.
CORONAVIRUS AID, RELIEF, AND ECONOMIC SECURITY (CARES) ACT
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act made additional changes to IRAs and 
retirement plans. Among the changes are:
• The 10% early distribution penalty for those under 59½ does not apply for coronavirus-
related distributions received in 2020 up to $100,000. In addition, the early withdrawal 
penalty does not apply to qualified birth or adoption distributions up to $5,000.
• The tax on a coronavirus-related distribution can be spread over three years.

 193  •  Chapter 17: Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)
• A coronavirus-related distribution can be recontributed within three years.
Statement of required minimum distribution. If a minimum distribution is required from your IRA, the 
trustee, custodian, or issuer that held the IRA at the end of the preceding year must either report the 
amount of the required minimum distribution to you, or offer to calculate it for you. The report or offer 
must include the date by which the amount must be distributed. The report is due January 31 of the year 
in which the minimum distribution is required. It can be provided with the year-end fair market value 
statement that you normally get each year. No report is required for IRAs of owners who have died.
IRA interest. Although interest earned from your IRA is generally not taxed in the year earned, it is not 
tax-exempt interest. Do not report this interest on your tax return as tax-exempt interest.
Net  Investment  Income  Tax. For purposes of the Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT), net investment 
income does not include distributions from a qualified retirement plan including IRAs (for example 401(a), 
403(a), 403(b), 408, 408A, or 457(b) plans). However, these distributions are taken into account when 
determining the modified adjusted gross income threshold. Distributions from a nonqualified retirement 
plan are included in net investment income.
Form 8606. To designate contributions as nondeductible, you must file Form 8606, Nondeductible IRAs.
Tip
 
The term “50 or older” is used several times in this chapter. It refers to an IRA owner 
who is age 50 or older by the end of the tax year.
III. INTRODUCTION 
An individual retirement arrangement (IRA) is a personal savings plan that offers you tax advantages to 
set aside money for your retirement.
This chapter discusses:  
1. The rules for a traditional IRA (any IRA that is not a Roth or SIMPLE IRA), and 
2. The Roth IRA, which features nondeductible contributions and tax-free distributions. 
Simplified Employee Pensions  (SEPs)  and  Savings  Incentive  Match  Plans  for  Employees  (SIMPLEs)  
are not discussed in this chapter. 
I V.  TR ADITIONAL IRAs 
In  this  chapter,  the  original  IRA  (sometimes  called  an  ordinary  or  regular  IRA)  is  referred  to  as  a 
“traditional IRA.” Two advantages of a traditional IRA are:  

 194  •  Chapter 17: Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)
1. You may be able to deduct some or all of your contributions to it, depending on your 
circumstances, and
2. Generally, amounts in your IRA, including earnings and gains, are not taxed until they are 
distributed. 
HOW MUCH CAN BE CONTRIBUTED?
There are limits and other rules that affect the amount that can be contributed and the amount you can 
deduct. These limits and some of the other rules are explained below. 
General limit. For 2024, the most that can be contributed to your traditional IRA generally is the smaller 
of the following amounts:  
1. $7,000 ($8,000 if you are 50 or older in 2024), or
2. Your taxable compensation (defined earlier) for the year.
This is the most that can be contributed regardless of whether the contributions are to one or more 
traditional IRAs  or  whether  all  or  part  of  the  contributions  are  nondeductible.  (See Nondeductible 
Contributions, later.) Qualified reservist payments do not affect this limit.
Example 1
 
Betty, who is 34 years old and single, earned $24,000 in 2024. Her IRA contributions 
for 2024 are limited to $7,000. 
 
Example 2
 
John, an unmarried college student working part time, earned $3,500 in 2024. His IRA 
contributions for 2024 are limited to $3,500, the amount of his compensation. 
Kay  Bailey  Hutchison  Spousal  IRA  limit.  For  2024,  if  you  file  a  joint  return  and  your  taxable 
compensation is less than that of your spouse, the most that can be contributed for the year to your IRA 
is the smaller of the following amounts:  
1. $8,000 ($8,000 if you are 50 or older).
2. The total compensation includible in the gross income of both you and your spouse for 
the year, reduced by the following two amounts.  
a) Your spouse’s contribution for the year to a traditional IRA. 

 195  •  Chapter 17: Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)
b) Any contribution for the year to a Roth IRA on behalf of your spouse.  
This means that the total combined contributions that can be made for the year to your IRA and your 
spouse’s IRA can be as much as $14,000 ($15,000 if only one of you is 50 or older, or $16,000 if both of 
you are 50 or older). 
WHEN CAN CONTRIBUTIONS BE MADE? 
As soon as you open your traditional IRA, contributions can be made to it through your chosen sponsor 
(trustee or other administrator). Contributions to a traditional IRA must be in the form of money (cash, 
check, or money order). Property cannot be contributed. 
Contributions must be made by due date. Contributions can be made to your traditional IRA for a year 
at any time during the year or by the due date for filing your return for that year, not including extensions. 
Designating year for which contribution is made. If an amount is contributed to your traditional IRA 
between January 1 and April 15, you should tell the sponsor which year (the current year or the previous 
year) the contribution is for. If you do not tell the sponsor which year it is for, the sponsor can assume, 
and report to the IRS, that the contribution is for the current year (the year the sponsor received it). 
Filing  before  a  contribution  is  made.  You can file your return claiming a traditional IRA contribution 
before the contribution is actually made. Generally, the contribution must be made by the due date of 
your return, not including extensions. 
Contributions  not  required. You do not have to contribute to your traditional IRA for every tax year, 
even if you can. 
HOW MUCH CAN YOU DEDUCT? 
Generally, you can deduct the lesser of: 
• The contributions to your traditional IRA for the year, or 
• The general limit (or the Kay Bailey Hutchison Spousal IRA limit, if it applies). 
However, if you or your spouse was covered by an employer retirement plan, you may not be able to 
deduct this amount. See Limit If Covered by Employer Plan, later. 
Trustees’ fees. Trustees’ administrative fees that are billed separately and paid in connection with your 
traditional IRA are not deductible as IRA contributions. You are also not able to deduct these fees as an 
itemized deduction. 
Brokers’  commissions.  Brokers’  commissions  are  part  of  your  IRA  contribution  and,  as  such,  are 
deductible subject to the limits. 
Full  deduction. If neither you nor your spouse was covered for any part of the year by an employer 
retirement plan, you can take a deduction for total contributions to one or more traditional IRAs of up to 
the lesser of:  

 196  •  Chapter 17: Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)
1. $7,000 ($8,000 if you are 50 or older in 2024), or 
2. 100% of your compensation. 
This limit is reduced by any contributions made to a 501(c)(18) plan on your behalf. 
Kay Bailey Hutchison Spousal IRA. In the case of a married couple with unequal compensation who file 
a joint return, the deduction for contributions to the traditional IRA of the spouse with less compensation 
is limited to the lesser of:  
1. $7,000 ($8,000 if 50 or older in 2024), or
2. The  total  compensation  includible  in  the  gross  income  of  both  spouses  for  the  year 
reduced by the following three amounts.  
a) The IRA deduction for the year of the spouse with the greater compensation. 
b) Any designated nondeductible contribution for the year made on behalf of 
the spouse with the greater compensation.
c) Any contributions for the year to a Roth IRA on behalf of the spouse with the 
greater compensation.
This limit is reduced by any contributions to a 501(c)(18) plan on behalf of the spouse with the lesser 
compensation. 
Covered  by  an  employer  retirement  plan.  If  you  or  your  spouse  was  covered  by  an  employer 
retirement plan at any time during the year for which contributions were made, your deduction may be 
further limited. This is discussed later under Limit If Covered by Employer Plan. Limits on the amount 
you can deduct do not affect the amount that can be contributed. See Nondeductible Contributions, later. 
Defined contribution plan. Generally, you are covered by a defined contribution plan for a tax year if 
amounts are contributed or allocated to your account for the plan year that ends with or within that tax 
year. 
A defined contribution plan is a plan that provides for a separate account for each person covered by 
the plan. Types of defined contribution plans include profit-sharing plans, stock bonus plans, and money 
purchase pension plans. 
Defined benefit plan. If you are eligible to participate in your employer’s defined benefit plan for the 
plan year that ends within your tax year, you are covered by the plan. This rule applies even if you: 
• Declined to participate in the plan, 
• Did not make a required contribution, or 
• Did not perform the minimum service required to accrue a benefit for the year. 
A defined benefit plan is any plan that is not a defined contribution plan. Defined benefit plans include 
pension plans and annuity plans. 

 197  •  Chapter 17: Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)
No  vested  interest. If you accrue a benefit for a plan year, you are covered by that plan even if you 
have no vested interest in (legal right to) the account or the accrual. 
Limit If Covered by Employer Plan 
If either you or your spouse was covered by an employer retirement plan, you may be entitled to only a 
partial (reduced) deduction or no deduction at all, depending on your income and your filing status. 
Your deduction begins to decrease (phase out) when your income rises above a certain amount and is 
eliminated  altogether  when  it  reaches  a  higher  amount.  These  amounts  vary  depending  on  your  filing 
status. 
To determine if your deduction is subject to phaseout, you must determine your modified adjusted gross 
income (AGI) and your filing status. Then use Table 17-1 or 17-2 to determine if the phaseout applies.

2. You are entitled to the full deduction if you did not live with your spouse at any time during the year.
If your spouse is covered. If you are not covered by an employer retirement plan, but your spouse is, 
and you did not receive any social security benefits, your IRA deduction may be reduced or eliminated 
entirely depending on your filing status and modified AGI as shown in Table 17-2. 
Filing status. Your filing status depends primarily on your marital status. For this purpose, you need to 
know if your filing status is single or head of household, married filing jointly or qualifying widow(er), or 
married filing separately. If you need more information on filing status, see chapter 2. 
Lived apart from spouse. If you did not live with your spouse at any time during the year and you file a 
separate return, your filing status, for this purpose, is single. 
Modified adjusted gross income (AGI). When filing Form 1040 or 1040-SR, refigure the amount on 
line 11 without taking into account any of the following amounts. 
• IRA deduction. 
• Student loan interest deduction.

 199  •  Chapter 17: Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)
• Foreign earned income exclusion. 
• Foreign housing exclusion or deduction.
• Exclusion of qualified savings bond interest shown on Form 8815, Exclusion of Interest 
From Series EE and I U.S. Savings Bonds Issued After 1989. 
• Exclusion of employer-paid adoption expenses shown on Form 8839, Qualified Adoption 
Expenses. 
This is your modified AGI. 
Both contributions for 2024 and distributions in 2024. If all three of the following occurred, any IRA 
distributions you received in 2024 may be partly tax free and partly taxable.  
1. You received distributions in 2024 from one or more traditional IRAs. 
2. You made contributions to a traditional IRA for 2024. 
3. Some of those contributions may be nondeductible contributions. 
If all three of the above occurred, you must figure the taxable part of the traditional IRA distribution 
before you can figure your modified AGI. 
NONDEDUCTIBLE CONTRIBUTIONS 
Although your deduction for IRA contributions may be reduced or eliminated, contributions can be made 
to your IRA up to the general limit or, if it applies, the Kay Bailey Hutchison Spousal IRA limit. The 
difference between your total permitted contributions and your IRA deduction, if any, is your nondeductible 
contribution. 
Example
Mike is 30 years old and single. In 2024, he was covered by a retirement plan at work. 
His salary was $72,000. His modified AGI was $90,000. Mike made a $7,000 IRA 
contribution for 2024. Because he was covered by a retirement plan and his modified 
AGI  was  over  $87,000,  he  cannot  deduct  his  $7,000  IRA  contribution.  He  must 
designate this contribution as a nondeductible contribution by reporting it on Form 
8606, as explained next. 
Form 8606. To designate contributions as nondeductible, you must file Form 8606.
You do not have to designate a contribution as nondeductible until you file your tax return. When you file, 
you can even designate otherwise deductible contributions as nondeductible.
You must file Form 8606 to report nondeductible contributions even if you do not have to file a tax return 
for the year. 

 200  •  Chapter 17: Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)
Tax on earnings on nondeductible contributions. As long as contributions are within the contribution 
limits, none of the earnings or gains on those contributions (deductible or nondeductible) will be taxed 
until they are distributed. 
Cost  basis. You will have a cost basis in your IRA if there are nondeductible contributions. Your cost 
basis is the sum of the nondeductible contributions to your IRA minus any withdrawals or distributions of 
nondeductible contributions. 
INHERITED IRAs 
If you inherit a traditional IRA, you are called a beneficiary. A beneficiary can be any person or entity the 
owner chooses to receive the benefits of the IRA after he or she dies. Beneficiaries of a traditional IRA 
must include in their gross income any taxable distributions they receive. 
Inherited from spouse. If you inherit a traditional IRA from your spouse, you generally have the following 
three choices. You can: 
1. Treat it as your own IRA by designating yourself as the account owner. 
2. Treat it as your own by rolling it over into your IRA, or to the extent it is taxable, into a: 
a) Qualified employer plan, 
b) Qualified employee annuity plan (section 403(a) plan), 
c) Tax-sheltered annuity plan (section 403(b) plan), or 
d) Deferred  compensation  plan  of  a  state  or  local  government  (section  457 
plan). 
3. Treat yourself as the beneficiary rather than treating the IRA as your own. 
Treating it as your own. You will be considered to have chosen to treat the IRA as your own if: 
• Contributions (including rollover contributions) are made to the inherited IRA, or 
• You do not take the required minimum distribution for a year as a beneficiary of the IRA. 
You will only be considered to have chosen to treat the IRA as your own if: 
• You are the sole beneficiary of the IRA, and 
• You have an unlimited right to withdraw amounts from it. 
However, if you receive a distribution from your deceased spouse’s IRA, you can roll that distribution over 
into your own IRA within the 60-day time limit, as long as the distribution is not a required distribution, 
even if you are not the sole beneficiary of your deceased spouse’s IRA. 
Inherited  from  someone  other  than  spouse.  If  you  inherit  a  traditional  IRA  from  anyone  other  than  
your deceased spouse, you cannot treat the inherited IRA as your own. This means that you cannot 
make contributions to the IRA and you cannot roll over any amounts out of the inherited IRA. However, 

 201  •  Chapter 17: Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)
you can make a trustee-to-trustee transfer as long as the IRA into which amounts are being moved is set 
up and maintained in the name of the deceased IRA owner for the benefit of you as beneficiary.
CAN YOU MOVE RETIREMENT PLAN ASSETS? 
You can transfer, tax free, assets (money or property) from other retirement plans (including traditional 
IRAs) to a traditional IRA. You can make the following kinds of transfers.
• Transfers from one trustee to another. 
• Rollovers. 
• Transfers incident to a divorce. 
Transfers to Roth IRAs. Under certain conditions, you can move assets from a traditional IRA or from a 
designated Roth account to a Roth IRA. You can also move assets from a qualified retirement plan to a 
Roth IRA. See Can You Move Amounts Into a Roth IRA? under Roth IRAs, later.
Trustee-to-Trustee Transfer 
A transfer of funds in your traditional IRA from one trustee directly to another, either at your request or 
at the trustee’s request, is not a rollover. This includes the situation where the current trustee issues 
a check to the new trustee but gives it to you to deposit. Because there is no distribution to you, the 
transfer is tax free. Because it is not a rollover, it is not affected by the 1-year waiting period required 
between rollovers, discussed later under Rollover From One IRA Into Another. 
Rollovers 
Generally, a rollover is a tax-free distribution to you of cash or other assets from one retirement plan that 
you contribute (roll over) to another retirement plan. The contribution to the second retirement plan is 
called a “rollover contribution.” 
Kinds  of  rollovers  to  a  traditional  IRA.  You  can  roll  over  amounts  from  the  following  plans  into  a  
traditional IRA:  
1. A traditional IRA, 
2. An employer’s qualified retirement plan for its employees, 
3. A deferred compensation plan of a state or local government (section 457 plan), or 
4. A tax-sheltered annuity plan (section 403 plan).  
Time limit for making a rollover contribution. You generally must make the rollover contribution by 
the 60th day after the day you receive the distribution from your traditional IRA or your employer’s plan. 
The IRS may waive the 60-day requirement where the failure to do so would be against equity or good 
conscience, such as in the event of a casualty, disaster, or other event beyond your reasonable control. 

 202  •  Chapter 17: Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)
Extension  of  rollover  period.  If  an  amount  distributed  to  you  from  a  traditional  IRA  or  a  qualified 
employer retirement plan is a frozen deposit at any time during the 60-day period allowed for a rollover, 
special rules extend the rollover period. 
Rollover from One IRA Into Another 
You can withdraw, tax free, all or part of the assets from one traditional IRA if you reinvest them within 
60 days in the same or another traditional IRA. Because this is a rollover, you cannot deduct the amount 
that you reinvest in an IRA. 
Waiting period between rollovers. Generally, if you make a tax-free rollover of any part of a distribution 
from a traditional IRA, you cannot, within a 1-year period, make a tax-free rollover of any later distribution 
from that same IRA. You also cannot make a tax-free rollover of any amount distributed, within the same 
1-year period, from the IRA into which you made the tax-free rollover. 
The 1-year period begins on the date you receive the IRA distribution, not on the date you roll it over into 
an IRA. Rules apply to the number of rollovers you can have with your traditional IRAs. See Application 
of one-rollover limitation, below.
Application  of  one  -rollover  limitation. You can make only one rollover from an IRA to another (or 
the same) IRA in any 1-year period, regardless of the number of IRAs you own. The limit applies by 
aggregating all of an individual’s IRAs, including SEP and SIMPLE IRAs, as well as traditional and Roth 
IRAs, effectively treating them as one IRA for purposes of the limit. However, trustee-to-trustee transfers 
between IRAs are not limited and rollovers from traditional IRAs to Roth IRAs (conversions) are not 
limited.
Partial rollovers. If you withdraw assets from a traditional IRA, you can roll over part of the withdrawal 
tax free and keep the rest of it. The amount you keep will generally be taxable (except for the part 
that is a return of nondeductible contributions) and may be subject to the 10% additional tax on early 
distributions, discussed later under What Acts Result in Penalties or Additional Taxes. 
Required distributions. Amounts that must be distributed during a particular year under the required 
distribution rules (discussed later) are not eligible for rollover treatment. 
Inherited IRAs. If you inherit a traditional IRA from your spouse, you generally can roll it over, or you can 
choose to make the inherited IRA your own. 
Rollover from Employer’s Plan Into an IRA 
You can roll over into a traditional IRA all or part of an eligible rollover distribution you receive from your 
(or your deceased spouse’s):  
1. Employer’s qualified pension, profit-sharing or stock bonus plan, 
2. Annuity plan, 
3. Tax-sheltered annuity plan (section 403(b) plan), or 

 203  •  Chapter 17: Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)
4. Governmental deferred compensation plan (section 457 plan). 
Eligible rollover distribution. Generally, an eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or part 
of the balance to your credit in a qualified retirement plan except:  
1. A required minimum distribution.
2. Hardship distributions.
3. Any of a series of substantially equal periodic distributions paid at least once a year over:  
a) Your lifetime or life expectancy, 
b) The lifetimes or life expectancies of you and your beneficiary, or 
c) A period of 10 years or more.
4. Corrective  distributions  of  excess  contributions  or  excess  deferrals,  and  any  income 
allocable to the excess, or of excess annual additions and any allocable gains.
5. A loan treated as a distribution because it does not satisfy certain requirements either 
when made or later (such as upon default), unless the participant’s accrued benefits are 
reduced (offset) to repay the loan.
6. Dividends on employer securities.
7. The cost of life insurance coverage.
Transfers Incident to Divorce 
If an interest in a traditional IRA is transferred from your spouse or former spouse to you by a divorce or 
separate maintenance decree or a written document related to such a decree, the interest in the IRA, 
starting from the date of the transfer, is treated as your IRA. The transfer is tax free. 
Converting from Any Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA
Allowable conversions. You can withdraw all or part of the assets from a traditional IRA and reinvest 
them (within 60 days) in a Roth IRA. The amount that you withdraw and timely contribute (convert) to the 
Roth IRA is called a conversion contribution. If properly (and timely) rolled over, the 10% additional tax 
on early distributions will not apply. 
Required  distributions.  You  cannot  convert  amounts  that  must  be  distributed  from  your  traditional 
IRA  for  a  particular  year  (including  the  calendar  year  in  which  you  reach  age  73)  under  the  required  
distribution rules (discussed later). 
Income. You must include in your gross income distributions from a traditional IRA that you would have 
to  include  in  income  if  you  had  not  converted  them  into  a  Roth  IRA.  These  amounts  are  included  in  
income on your return for the year that you converted them from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. You do 
not include in gross income any part of a distribution from a traditional IRA that is a return of your basis, 
as discussed later.

 204  •  Chapter 17: Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)
If you must include any amount in your gross income, you may have to increase your withholding or 
make estimated tax payments.
Recharacterizations
You may be able to treat a contribution made to one type of IRA as having been made to a different type 
of IRA. This is called recharacterizing the contribution. 
How to recharacterize a contribution. To recharacterize a contribution, you generally must have the 
contribution transferred from the first IRA (the one to which it was made) to the second IRA in a trustee-
to-trustee transfer. If the transfer is made by the due date (including extensions) for your tax return for 
the year during which the contribution was made, you can elect to treat the contribution as having been 
originally made to the second IRA instead of to the first IRA. If you recharacterize your contribution, you 
must do all three of the following.
• Include in the transfer any net income allocable to the contribution. If there was a loss, the 
net income you must transfer may be a negative amount.
• Report the recharacterization on your tax return for the year during which the contribution 
was made.
• Treat the contribution as having been made to the second IRA on the date that it was 
actually made to the first IRA.
No  recharacterizations  of  conversions  made  in  2018  or  later.  A  conversion  of  a  traditional  IRA  to  
a Roth IRA, and a rollover from any other eligible retirement plan to a Roth IRA, made in tax years 
beginning after December 31, 2017, cannot be recharacterized as having been made to a traditional 
IRA. 
No deduction allowed. You cannot deduct the contribution to the first IRA. Any net income you transfer 
with the recharacterized contribution is treated as earned in the second IRA. 
How do you recharacterize a contribution? To recharacterize a contribution, you must notify both the 
trustee of the first IRA (the one to which the contribution was actually made) and the trustee of the second 
IRA (the one to which the contribution is being moved) that you have elected to treat the contribution as 
having been made to the second IRA rather than the first. You must make the notifications by the date 
of the transfer. Only one notification is required if both IRAs are maintained by the same trustee. The 
notification(s) must include all of the following information.
• The type and amount of the contribution to the first IRA that is to be recharacterized.
• The date on which the contribution was made to the first IRA and the year for which it was 
made.

 205  •  Chapter 17: Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)
• A direction to the trustee of the first IRA to transfer in a trustee-to-trustee transfer the 
amount of the contribution and any net income (or loss) allocable to the contribution to 
the trustee of the second IRA.
• The name of the trustee of the first IRA and the name of the trustee of the second IRA.
• Any additional information needed to make the transfer.
Reporting  a  recharacterization.  If  you  elect  to  recharacterize  a  contribution  to  one  IRA  as  a     
contribution to another IRA, you must report the recharacterization on your tax return as directed by 
Form 8606 and its instructions. You must treat the contribution as having been made to the second IRA.
WHEN CAN YOU WITHDRAW OR USE IRA ASSETS?
There are rules limiting use of your IRA assets and distributions from it. Violation of the rules generally 
results in additional taxes in the year of violation. See What Acts Result in Penalties or Additional Taxes. 
Early distributions tax. The 10% additional tax on distributions made before you reach age 59½ does 
not apply to contributions returned before the due date of the return. However, the distribution of interest 
or other income must be reported on Form 5329 and, unless the distribution qualifies as an exception to 
the age 59½ rule, it will be subject to this tax. 
WHEN MUST YOU WITHDRAW IRA ASSETS? (REQUIRED MINIMUM DISTRIBUTIONS) 
You cannot keep funds in your traditional IRA indefinitely. Eventually they must be distributed. If there 
are no distributions, or if the distributions are not large enough, you may have to pay a 25% (previously 
50%)  excise  tax  on  the  amount  not  distributed  as  required.  See Excess Accumulations (Insufficient 
Distributions), later. The requirements for distributing IRA funds differ depending on whether you are the 
IRA owner or the beneficiary of a decedent’s IRA. 
Distributions not eligible for rollover. Amounts that must be distributed (required distributions) during 
a particular year are not eligible for rollover treatment. 
IRA owners. If you are the owner of a traditional IRA, you must start receiving distributions from your IRA 
by April 1 of the year following the year in which you reach age 72 (73 if you did not reach age 72 before 
January 1, 2023). April 1 of the year following the year in which you reach age 72 (73 if applicable) is 
referred to as the required beginning date.
Distributions by the required beginning date. You must receive at least a minimum amount for each 
year starting with the year you reach age 72 (73 if you did not reach age 72 before January 1, 2023). 
If you do not (or did not) receive that minimum amount in the year you became 72 (73 if applicable), 
then you must receive distributions for the year you become 72 (73 if applicable) by April 1 of the next 
year. If an IRA owner dies after reaching age 72 (73 if applicable), but before April 1 of the next year, no 
minimum distribution is required because death occurred before the required beginning date.

 206  •  Chapter 17: Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)
Caution!
Even if you begin receiving distributions before you attain age 72 (73 if applicable), you 
must begin calculating and receiving required minimum distributions by your required 
beginning date.
Distributions after the required beginning date. The required minimum distribution for any year after 
the year you turn 72 (73 if applicable) must be made by December 31 of that later year. 
Beneficiaries. If you are the beneficiary of a decedent’s traditional IRA, the requirements for distributions 
from that IRA generally depend on whether the IRA owner died before or after the required beginning 
date for distributions. 
ARE DISTRIBUTIONS TAXABLE? 
In general, distributions from a traditional IRA are taxable in the year you receive them. 
Exceptions
Exceptions to distributions from traditional IRAs being taxable in the year you receive 
them are:
• Rollovers,
• Qualified charitable distributions, discussed later,
• Tax-free withdrawals of contributions, discussed earlier, and 
• The  return  of  nondeductible  contributions,  discussed  later  under 
Distributions Fully or Partly Taxable.
Qualified charitable distributions. A qualified charitable distribution (QCD) is generally a nontaxable 
distribution made directly by the trustee of your IRA to an organization eligible to receive tax-deductible 
contributions. 
Ordinary income. Distributions from traditional IRAs that you include in income are taxed as ordinary 
income. 
No  special  treatment.  In  figuring  your  tax,  you  cannot  use  the  10-year  tax  option  or  capital  gain 
treatment that applies to lump-sum distributions from qualified retirement plans. 
Distributions Fully or Partly Taxable 
Distributions from your traditional IRA may be fully or partly taxable, depending on whether your IRA 
includes any nondeductible contributions. 

 207  •  Chapter 17: Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)
Fully  taxable. If only deductible contributions were made to your traditional IRA (or IRAs, if you have 
more than one), you have no basis in your IRA. Because you have no basis in your IRA, any distributions 
are fully taxable when received. 
Partly taxable. If you made nondeductible contributions or rolled over any after-tax amounts to any of 
your traditional IRAs, you have a cost basis (investment in the contract) equal to the amount of those 
contributions. These nondeductible contributions are not taxed when they are distributed to you. They 
are a return of your investment in your IRA. 
Only the part of the distribution that represents nondeductible contributions and rolled over after-tax 
amounts (your cost basis) is tax free. If nondeductible contributions have been made or after-tax amounts 
have been rolled over to your IRA, distributions consist partly of nondeductible contributions (basis) and 
partly of deductible contributions, earnings, and gains (if there are any). Until all of your basis has been 
distributed, each distribution is partly nontaxable and partly taxable.
IRA distributions delivered outside the United States. In general, if you are a U.S. citizen or resident 
alien  and  your  home  address  is  outside  the  United  States  or  its  possessions,  you  cannot  choose 
exemption from withholding on distributions from your traditional IRA. 
WHAT ACTS RESULT IN PENALTIES OR ADDITIONAL TAXES? 
The tax advantages of using traditional IRAs for retirement savings can be offset by additional taxes and 
penalties if you do not follow the rules. There are additions to the regular tax for using your IRA funds in 
prohibited transactions. There are also additional taxes for the following activities. 
• Investing in collectibles.
• Having unrelated business income.
• Making excess contributions. 
• Taking early distributions. 
• Allowing excess amounts to accumulate (failing to take required distributions). 
There are penalties for overstating the amount of nondeductible contributions and for failure to file a 
Form 8606, if required. 
Prohibited Transactions 
Generally, a prohibited transaction is any improper use of your traditional IRA by you, your beneficiary, or 
any disqualified person. 
Disqualified  persons  include  your  fiduciary  and  members  of  your  family  (spouse,  ancestor,  lineal 
descendant, and any spouse of a lineal descendant). 
The following are examples of prohibited transactions with a traditional IRA. 
• Borrowing money from it. 

 208  •  Chapter 17: Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)
• Selling property to it. 
• Using it as security for a loan. 
• Buying property for personal use (present or future) with IRA funds. 
Effect on an IRA account. Generally, if you or your beneficiary engages in a prohibited transaction in 
connection with your traditional IRA account at any time during the year, the account stops being an IRA 
as of the first day of that year. 
Taxes on prohibited transactions. If someone other than the owner or beneficiary of a traditional IRA 
engages in a prohibited transaction, that person may be liable for certain taxes. In general, there is a 
15% tax on the amount of the prohibited transaction and a 100% additional tax if the transaction is not 
corrected. 
Investment in Collectibles 
If your traditional IRA invests in collectibles, the amount invested is considered distributed to you in the 
year invested. You may have to pay the 10% additional tax on early distributions, discussed later. 
Collectibles. These include: 
• Artworks, 
• Rugs, 
• Antiques, 
• Metals, 
• Gems, 
• Stamps, 
• Coins, 
• Alcoholic beverages, and 
• Certain other tangible personal property. 
Exception
Your IRA can invest in one, one-half, one-quarter, or one-tenth ounce U.S. gold coins, 
or one-ounce silver coins minted by the Treasury Department. It can also invest in 
certain platinum coins and certain gold, silver, palladium, and platinum bullion.

 209  •  Chapter 17: Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)
Early Distributions 
You must include early distributions of taxable amounts from your traditional IRA in your gross income. 
Early distributions are also subject to an additional 10% tax. 
Early  distributions  defined. Early  distributions  are  amounts  distributed  from  your  traditional  IRA 
account or annuity before you are age 59½. 
Age 59½ rule. Generally, if you are under age 59½, you must pay a 10% additional tax on the distribution 
of any assets (money or other property) from your traditional IRA. Distributions before you are age 59½ 
are called early distributions. 
The 10% additional tax applies to the part of the distribution that you have to include in gross income. It 
is in addition to any regular income tax on that amount.
Exceptions
There are several exceptions to the age 59½ rule. Even if you receive a distribution 
before you are age 59½, you may not have to pay the 10% additional tax if you are in 
one of the following situations.
• You have unreimbursed medical expenses that are more than 7.5% of 
your adjusted gross income.
• The distributions are not more than the cost of your medical insurance 
due to a period of unemployment.
• You are totally and permanently disabled.
• You have been certified as having a terminal illness.
• You are the beneficiary of a deceased IRA owner.
• You are receiving distributions in the form of a series of substantially 
equal periodic payments.
• The distributions are for your qualified higher education expenses.
• You use the distributions to buy, build, or rebuild a first home.

 210  •  Chapter 17: Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)
Exceptions (continued)
• The distribution is due to an IRS levy of the qualified plan.
• The distribution is a qualified reservist distribution.
• The distribution is a qualified birth or adoption distribution.
• The distribution is a qualified disaster distribution or qualified disaster 
recovery distribution.
• The distribution is a corrective distribution.
Additional 10% tax. The additional tax on early distributions is 10% of the amount of the early distribution 
that you must include in your gross income. This tax is in addition to any regular income tax resulting 
from including the distribution in income. 
Nondeductible contributions. The tax on early distributions does not apply to the part of a distribution 
that represents a return of your nondeductible contributions (basis).
Excess Accumulations (Insufficient Distributions) 
You  cannot  keep  amounts  in  your  traditional  IRA  indefinitely.  Generally,  you  must  begin  receiving 
distributions by April 1 of the year following the year in which you reach age 72 (73 if you did not reach 
age 72 before January 1, 2023). The required minimum distribution for any year after you reach age 72 
(73 if applicable) must be made by December 31 of that later year.
Tax  on  excess.  If distributions are less than the required minimum distribution for the year, you may 
have to pay a 25% excise tax (and possibly 10% if the RMD is timely corrected within 2 years) for that 
year on the amount not distributed as required.
Note
 
The penalty for insufficient distributions was reduced in 2023 from 50% by the passage 
of the SECURE Act 2.0.
V.   ROTH IRAs 
Regardless  of  your  age,  you  may  be  able  to  establish  and  make  nondeductible  contributions  to  a 
retirement plan called a Roth IRA. 
Contributions not reported. You do not report Roth IRA contributions on your return. 

 211  •  Chapter 17: Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)
WHAT IS A ROTH IRA? 
A Roth IRA is an individual retirement plan that, except as explained in this chapter, is subject to the 
rules that apply to a traditional IRA. It can be either an account or an annuity. 
To be a Roth IRA, the account or annuity must be designated as a Roth IRA when it is opened. A deemed 
IRA can be a Roth IRA, Roth SEP IRA, or a Roth SIMPLE IRA. 
Unlike  a  traditional  IRA,  you  cannot  deduct  contributions  to  a  Roth  IRA.  But,  if  you  satisfy  the 
requirements, qualified distributions (discussed later) are tax free. Contributions can be made to your 
Roth IRA at any age. You can leave amounts in your Roth IRA as long as you live. 
WHEN CAN A ROTH IRA BE OPENED? 
You can open a Roth IRA at any time. However, the time for making contributions for any year is limited. 
See When Can You Make Contributions, later under Can You Contribute to a Roth IRA. 
CAN YOU CONTRIBUTE TO A ROTH IRA? 
Generally, you can contribute to a Roth IRA if you have taxable compensation (defined later) and your 
modified AGI (defined later) is less than: 
• $240,000 for married filing jointly, or qualifying surviving spouse,
• $161,000 for single, head of household, or married filing separately and you did not live 
with your spouse at any time during the year, and
• $10,000 for married filing separately and you lived with your spouse at any time during 
the year. 
Is  there  an  age  limit  for  contributions? Contributions can be made to your Roth IRA regardless of 
your age. 
Can you contribute to a Roth IRA for your spouse? You can contribute to a Roth IRA for your spouse 
provided the contributions satisfy the Kay Bailey Hutchison Spousal IRA limit (discussed in How Much 
Can Be Contributed? under Traditional IRAs), you file jointly, and your modified AGI is less than $240,000. 
Compensation. Compensation includes wages, salaries, tips, professional fees, bonuses, and other 
amounts  received  for  providing  personal  services.  It  also  includes  commissions,  self-employment 
income, nontaxable combat pay, military differential pay, taxable alimony  and  separate  maintenance  
payments, and taxable non-tuition fellowship and stipend payments. 
Modified AGI. Your modified AGI for Roth IRA purposes is your adjusted gross income (AGI) as shown 
on your return with some adjustments. 
How Much Can Be Contributed? 
The contribution limit for Roth IRAs generally depends on whether contributions are made only to Roth 
IRAs or to both traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs. 

 212  •  Chapter 17: Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)
Roth IRAs  only. If contributions are made only to Roth IRAs, your contribution limit generally is the 
lesser of:
• $7,000 ($8,000 if you are 50 or older in 2024), or 
• Your taxable compensation. 
However, if your modified AGI is above a certain amount, your contribution limit may be reduced, as 
explained later under Contribution limit reduced. 
Roth IRAs  and  traditional  IRAs. If contributions are made to both Roth IRAs  and  traditional  IRAs 
established for your benefit, your contribution limit for Roth IRAs  generally  is  the  same  as  your  limit  
would be if contributions were made only to Roth IRAs, but then reduced by all contributions for the year 
to all IRAs other than Roth IRAs. Employer contributions under a SEP or SIMPLE IRA plan do not affect 
this limit.
This means that your contribution limit is generally the lesser of: 
• $7,000 ($8,000 if you are 50 or older in 2024) minus all contributions (other than employer 
contributions under a SEP or SIMPLE IRA plan) for the year to all IRAs other than Roth 
IRAs, or 
• Your  taxable  compensation  minus  all  contributions  (other  than  employer  contributions 
under a SEP or SIMPLE IRA plan) for the year to all IRAs other than Roth IRAs. 
However, if your modified AGI is above a certain amount, your contribution limit may be reduced, as 
explained next under Contribution limit reduced. 
Contribution limit reduced. If your modified AGI is above a certain amount, your contribution limit is 
gradually reduced. Use Table 17-3 to determine if this reduction applies to you.
TABLE 17-3. EFFECT OF MODIFIED AGI ON ROTH IRA CONTRIBUTION

When Can You Make Contributions? 
You can make contributions to a Roth IRA for a year at any time during the year or by the due date of 
your return for that year (not including extensions). 
What If You Contribute Too Much? 
A 6% excise tax applies to any excess contribution to a Roth IRA. 
Excess contributions. These are the contributions to your Roth IRAs for a year that equal the total  of:  
1. Amounts contributed for the tax year to your Roth IRAs  (other  than  amounts  properly  
and  timely  rolled  over  from  a  Roth  IRA  or  properly  converted  from  a  traditional  IRA  or  
rolled over from a qualified retirement plan, as described later) that are more than your 
contribution limit for the year, plus
2. Any excess contributions for the preceding year, reduced by the total of:  
a) Any distributions out of your Roth IRAs for the year, plus 
b) Your contribution limit for the year minus your contributions to all your IRAs 
for the year.  
CAN YOU MOVE AMOUNTS INTO A ROTH IRA?
Conversions 
You may be able to convert amounts from either a traditional, SEP, or SIMPLE IRA into a Roth IRA. You 
may be able to roll amounts over from a qualified retirement plan to a Roth IRA. You may be able to 

 214  •  Chapter 17: Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)
recharacterize contributions made to one IRA as having been made directly to a different IRA. You can 
roll amounts over from a designated Roth account or from one Roth IRA to another Roth IRA.
Conversion  methods.  You  can  convert  amounts  from  a  traditional  IRA  to  a  Roth  IRA  in  any  of  the  
following three ways.  
1. Rollover. You can receive a distribution from a traditional IRA and roll it over (contribute 
it) to a Roth IRA within 60 days after the distribution. 
2. Trustee-to-trustee transfer. You can direct the trustee of the traditional IRA to transfer 
an amount from the traditional IRA to the trustee of the Roth IRA. 
3. Same trustee transfer. If the trustee of the traditional IRA also maintains the Roth IRA, 
you can direct the trustee to transfer an amount from the traditional IRA to the Roth IRA.  
Same trustee. Conversions made with the same trustee can be made by redesignating the traditional 
IRA as a Roth IRA, rather than opening a new account or issuing a new contract. 
Rollover  from  employer’s  plan  into  a  Roth  IRA.  You  can  roll  over  into  a  Roth  IRA  all  or  part  of  an  
eligible rollover distribution you receive from your (or your deceased spouse’s): 
• Employer’s qualified pension, profit-sharing or stock bonus plan, 
• Annuity plan,
• Tax-sheltered annuity plan (section 403(b) plan), or 
• Governmental deferred compensation plan (section 457 plan). 
Any amount rolled over is subject to the same rules for converting a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA. Also, 
the rollover contribution must meet the rollover requirements that apply to the specific type of retirement 
plan. 
Income. You must include in your gross income distributions from a qualified retirement plan that you 
would have had to include in income if you had not rolled them over into a Roth IRA. You do not include 
in gross income any part of a distribution from a qualified retirement plan that is a return of contributions 
(after-tax contributions) to the plan that were taxable to you when paid. These amounts are normally 
included in income on your return for the year you rolled them over from the employer plan to a Roth 
IRA.
Caution!
 
If you must include any amount in your gross income, you may have to increase your 
withholding or make estimated tax payments.

 215  •  Chapter 17: Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)
Converting from a SIMPLE IRA. Generally, you can convert an amount in your SIMPLE IRA to a Roth 
IRA under the same rules explained earlier under Converting from any traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. 
However, you cannot convert any amount distributed from the SIMPLE IRA during the 2-year period 
beginning on the date you first participated in any SIMPLE IRA plan maintained by your employer. 
Rollover from a Roth IRA 
You can withdraw, tax free, all or part of the assets from one Roth IRA if you contribute them within 60 
days to another Roth IRA. Most of the rules for rollovers explained under Rollover From One IRA Into 
Another under Traditional IRAs, earlier, apply to these rollovers.
Rollover from designated Roth account. A rollover from a designated Roth account can only be made 
to another designated Roth account or to a Roth IRA. 
ARE DISTRIBUTIONS TAXABLE? 
You do not include in your gross income qualified distributions or distributions that are a return of your 
regular contributions from your Roth IRA(s). You also do not include distributions from your Roth IRA that 
you roll over tax free into another Roth IRA. You may have to include part of other distributions in your 
income. See Ordering rules for distributions, later. 
What are qualified distributions? A qualified distribution is any payment or distribution from your Roth 
IRA that meets the following requirements.  
1. It  is  made  after  the  5-year  period  beginning  with  the  first  taxable  year  for  which  a 
contribution was made to a Roth IRA set up for your benefit, and
2. The payment or distribution is:
a) Made on or after the date you reach age 59½,
b) Made because you are disabled, 
c) Made to a beneficiary or to your estate after your death, or 
d) To pay up to $10,000 (lifetime limit) of certain qualified first-time homebuyer 
amounts.   
Additional  tax  on  distributions  of  conversion  and  certain  rollover  contributions  within  5-year  
period. If, within the 5-year period starting with the first day of your tax year in which you convert an 
amount from a traditional IRA or rollover an amount from a qualified retirement plan to a Roth IRA, you 
take a distribution from a Roth IRA, you may have to pay the 10% additional tax on early distributions. 
You generally must pay the 10% additional tax on any amount attributable to the part of the amount 
converted or rolled over (the conversion or rollover contribution) that you had to include in income. A

later, to determine the amount, if any, of the distribution that is attributable to the part of the conversion or 
rollover contribution that you had to include in income.

Additional  tax  on  other  early  distributions.  Unless  an  exception  applies,  you  must  pay  the  10% 
additional tax on the taxable part of any distributions that are not qualified distributions.
Ordering rules for distributions. If you receive a distribution from your Roth IRA that is not a qualified 
distribution, part of it may be taxable. There is a set order in which contributions (including conversion 
contributions) and earnings are considered to be distributed from your Roth IRA. Regular contributions 
are distributed first. 
Must  you  withdraw  or  use  Roth  IRA  assets? You are not required to take distributions from your 
Roth IRA at any age. The minimum distribution rules that apply to traditional IRAs do not apply to Roth 
IRAs while the owner is alive. However, after the death of a Roth IRA owner, certain of the minimum 
distribution rules that apply to traditional IRAs also apply to Roth IRAs.

CHAPTER 18: ALIMONY
Chapter Objective
After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• Recognize what is and is not alimony.
I.   REMINDER
Nondeductibility of alimony. Generally, for divorce or separation agreements executed after December 
31, 2018, you may no longer deduct an amount equal to the alimony or separate maintenance payments 
paid during the tax year, nor will the alimony or separate maintenance payments be included in the gross 
income of the recipient spouse.
II. INTRODUCTION 
This chapter discusses the rules that apply if you pay or receive alimony. It covers the following topics: 
• What payments are alimony, 
• What payments are not alimony, such as child support, and
• Whether you must recapture the tax benefits of alimony. Recapture means adding back in 
your income all or part of a deduction you took in a prior year. 
Alimony is a payment to or for a spouse or former spouse under a divorce or separation instrument. It 
does not include voluntary payments that are not made under a divorce or separation instrument.
For  divorce  or  separation  agreements  executed  before  January  1,  2019,  alimony  is  deductible  by 
the payer and must be included in the spouse’s or former spouse’s income. Although this chapter is 
generally written for the payer of the alimony, the recipient can use the information to determine whether 
an amount received is alimony.
To be alimony, a payment must meet certain requirements. Different requirements apply to payments 
under instruments executed after 1984 and to payments under instruments executed before 1985. This 
chapter discusses the rules for payments under instruments executed after 1984. 
Use Table 18-1 in this chapter as a guide to determine whether certain payments are considered alimony.

final decree or agreement). 

 225  •  Chapter 18: Alimony
III. GENERAL RULES 
For divorce or separation agreements executed after December 31, 2018, you may no longer deduct an 
amount equal to the alimony or separate maintenance payments paid during the tax year, nor will the 
alimony or separate maintenance payments be included in the gross income of the recipient spouse. For 
divorce or separation agreements executed before January 1, 2019, the following rules apply to alimony.
Payments not alimony. Not all payments under a divorce or separation instrument are alimony. Alimony 
does not include any of the following.  
1. Child support. 
2. Noncash property settlements. 
3. Payments that are your spouse’s part of community income. 
4. Payments to keep up the payer’s property. 
5. Use of the payer’s property.  
Payments  to  a  third  party.  Cash payments, checks, or money orders to a third party on behalf of 
your spouse under the terms of your divorce or separation instrument can be alimony if they otherwise 
qualify. These include payments for your spouse’s medical expenses, housing costs (rent, utilities, etc.), 
taxes, tuition, etc. The payments are treated as received by your spouse and then paid to the third party. 
Life insurance premiums. Alimony includes premiums you must pay under your divorce or separation 
instrument for insurance on your life to the extent your spouse owns the policy. 
Payments for jointly-owned home. If your divorce or separation instrument states that you must pay 
expenses for a home owned by you and your spouse or former spouse, some of your payments may be 
alimony. 
Mortgage  payments.  If  you  must  pay  all  the  mortgage  payments  (principal  and  interest)  on  a  jointly-
owned home, and they otherwise qualify, you can deduct one-half of the total payments as alimony. If 
you itemize deductions and the home is a qualified home, you can claim half of the interest in figuring 
your deductible interest. Your spouse must report one-half of the payments as alimony received. If your 
spouse itemizes deductions and the home is a qualified home, he or she can claim one-half of the 
interest on the mortgage in figuring deductible interest. 
Taxes and insurance. If you must pay all the real estate taxes or insurance on a home held as tenants 
in common, you can deduct one-half of these payments as alimony. Your spouse must report one-half 
of these payments as alimony received. If you and your spouse itemize deductions, you can each claim 
one-half of the real estate taxes and none of the home insurance. 
If your home is held as tenants by the entirety or joint tenants, none of your payments for taxes or 
insurance are alimony. But if you itemize deductions, you can claim all of the real estate taxes and none 
of the home insurance. 

 226  •  Chapter 18: Alimony
I V.  INSTRUMENTS EXECUTED AFTER 1984 AND BEFORE 2019 
The  following  rules  for  alimony  apply  to  payments  under  divorce  or  separation  instruments  executed  
after 1984, and before 2019. 
Alimony  requirements.  A  payment  to  or  for  a  spouse  under  a  divorce  or  separation  instrument  is  
alimony if the spouses do not file a joint return with each other and all the following requirements are 
met.  
1. The payment is in cash. 
2. The instrument does not designate the payment as not alimony. 
3. The spouses are not members of the same household at the time the payments are 
made. This requirement applies only if the spouses are legally separated under a decree 
of divorce or separate maintenance. 
4. There is no liability to make any payment (in cash or property) after the death of the 
recipient spouse. 
5. The payment is not treated as child support. 
Cash  payment  requirement.  Only  cash  payments,  including  checks  and  money  orders,  qualify  as 
alimony. The following do not qualify as alimony. 
• Transfers of services or property (including a debt instrument of a third party or an annuity 
contract). 
• Execution of a debt instrument by the payer. 
• The use of the payer’s property. 
Payments to a third party. Cash payments to a third party under the terms of your divorce or separation 
instrument can qualify as a cash payment to your spouse. See Payments to a third party under General 
Rules, earlier. 
Also, cash payments made to a third party at the written request of your spouse qualify as alimony if all 
the following requirements are met.  
1. The payments are in lieu of payments of alimony directly to your spouse. 
2. The  written  request  states  that  both  spouses  intend  the  payments  to  be  treated  as 
alimony. 
3. You receive the written request from your spouse before you file your return for the year 
you made the payments.  
Child  support. A  payment  that  is  specifically  designated  as child  support  or  treated  as  specifically 
designated as child support under your divorce or separation instrument is not alimony. The amount of 

 227  •  Chapter 18: Alimony
child support may vary from time to time. Child support payments are not deductible by the payer and 
are not taxable to the recipient.
Specifically designated as child support. A payment will be treated as specifically designated as child 
support to the extent that the payment is reduced either:  
1. On the happening of a contingency relating to your child, or 
2. At a time that can be clearly associated with the contingency. 
A payment may be treated as specifically designated as child support even if other separate payments 
are specifically designated as child support.
V.   RECAPTURE RULE 
If your alimony payments decrease or end during the first 3 calendar years, you may be subject to the 
recapture rule. If you are subject to this rule, you have to include in income in the third year part of the 
alimony payments you previously deducted. Your spouse can deduct in the third year part of the alimony 
payments he or she previously included in income. 
The 3-year period starts with the first calendar year you make a payment qualifying as alimony under a 
decree of divorce or separate maintenance or a written separation agreement. Do not include any time 
in which payments were being made under temporary support orders. The second and third years are 
the next 2 calendar years, whether or not payments are made during those years. 
The reasons for a reduction or termination of alimony payments that can require a recapture include: 
• A change in your divorce or separation instrument, 
• A failure to make timely payments, 
• A reduction in your ability to provide support, or 
• A reduction in your spouse’s support needs. 
When to apply the recapture rule. You are subject to the recapture rule in the third year if the alimony 
you pay in the third year decreases by more than $15,000 from the second year or the alimony you pay 
in the second and third years decreases significantly from the alimony you pay in the first year.
When you figure a decrease in alimony, do not include the following amounts.  
1. Payments made under a temporary support order. 
2. Payments required over a period of at least 3 calendar years of a fixed part of your income 
from a business or property, or from compensation for employment or self-employment. 
3. Payments that decrease because of the death of either spouse or the remarriage of the 
spouse receiving the payments before the end of the third year.  

 228  •  Chapter 18: Alimony
Including  the  recapture  in  income. If you must include a recapture amount in income, show it on 
Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 2a (“Alimony  received”).  Cross  out  “received”  and  enter  “recapture.”  On  
the dotted line next to the amount, enter your spouse’s last name and SSN or ITIN. 
Deducting the recapture. If you can deduct a recaptured amount, show it on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), 
line  19a  (“Alimony paid”). Cross out “paid” and enter “recapture.” In the space provided, enter your 
spouse’s SSN or ITIN.
CERTAIN RULES FOR INSTRUMENTS EXECUTED OR MODIFIED AFTER 2018 
Amounts paid as alimony or separate maintenance payments under a divorce or separation instrument 
executed after 2018 will not be deductible by the payer. Such amounts also will not be includible in 
the income of the recipient. The same is true of alimony paid under a divorce or separation instrument 
executed before 2019 and modified after 2018 if the modification expressly states that the alimony is not 
deductible to the payer or includible in the income of the recipient. The examples below illustrate the tax 
treatment of alimony payments under the post-2018 alimony rules. In each of the examples, assume the 
payments qualify as alimony under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Example 1
On December 2, 2016, a court executed a divorce decree providing for monthly alimony 
payments beginning January 1, 2017, for a period of 9 years. On May 15, 2024, the court 
modified the divorce decree to increase the amount of monthly alimony payments. The 
first increased alimony payment was due on June 1, 2024. The modification did not 
expressly provide that the post-2018 alimony rules apply to alimony payments made 
after the date of the modification. Therefore, all alimony payments made in 2024 are 
includible in the recipient’s income and deductible from the payer’s income.
Example 2
Assume  the  same  facts  as  in  Example  1  above,  except  the  modification  expressly  
provided  that  the  post-2018  alimony  rules  apply.  The  alimony  payments  made  in 
January 2024 through May 2024 are includible in the recipient’s income and deductible 
from the payer’s income. The alimony payments made in June 2024 through December 
2024 are neither includible in the recipient’s income nor deductible from the payer’s 
income.

 229  •  Chapter 18: Alimony
Example 3
On December 2, 2016, a couple executed a written separation agreement providing for 
monthly alimony payments on the first day of each month, beginning January 1, 2017, 
for a period of 9 years. The written separation agreement set forth that it expires upon 
the execution of a divorce decree dissolving the couple’s marriage. On May 27, 2024, a 
court executed the divorce decree awarding alimony under the same terms as described 
in the couple’s separation agreement. The alimony payments made in January 2024 
through  May  2024  under  the  written  separation  agreement  are  includible  in  the 
recipient’s income and deductible from the payer’s income. The court executed the 
divorce decree after December 31, 2018; therefore, alimony payments made in June 
2024 through December 2024 under the divorce decree are neither includible in the 
recipient’s income nor deductible from the payer’s income.
Example 4
On October 1, 2018, a couple executed a written separation agreement subject to the 
laws of State X. The written separation agreement requires a $1,000 monthly alimony 
payment on the last business day of a month for a period of 6 years. Under the laws of  
State X, at the time of divorce, a written separation agreement may survive as an 
independent contract. In the process of obtaining their divorce, the couple decided their 
separation agreement will remain an independent contract and won’t be incorporated 
or merged into their divorce decree. The court, after acknowledging the separation 
agreement as fair and equitable, executed a divorce decree on April 1, 2024, dissolving 
the  couple’s  marriage.  The  divorce  decree  did  not  mention  alimony.  All  alimony 
payments made in 2024 are includible in the recipient’s income and deductible from the 
payer’s income because the alimony payments were made under the written separation 
agreement that was executed on or before December 31, 2018.

CHAPTER 19: EDUCATION-RELATED 
ADJUSTMENTS
Chapter Objective
After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• Identify education-related adjustments that can be made to income.
I.   EDUCATOR EXPENSES
If you were an eligible educator in 2024, you can deduct up to $300 of qualified expenses you paid in 
2024 as an adjustment to gross income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 11. 
If you and your spouse are filing jointly and both of you were eligible educators, the maximum deduction 
is $600. However, neither spouse can deduct more than $300 of his or her qualified expenses. 
Eligible educator. An eligible educator is a kindergarten through grade 12 teacher, instructor, counselor, 
principal, or aide in a school for at least 900 hours during a school year.
Qualified expenses. Qualified expenses include ordinary and necessary expenses paid in connection 
with  books,  supplies,  equipment  (including  computer  equipment,  software,  and  services),  and  other 
materials  used  in  the  classroom.  An  ordinary  expense  is  one  that  is  common  and  accepted  in  your  
educational field. A necessary expense is one that is helpful and appropriate for your profession as an 
educator. An expense does not have to be required to be considered necessary.
Qualified expenses also include those expenses you incur while participating in professional development 
courses related to the curriculum in which you provide instruction. It also includes those expenses related 
to those students for whom you provide that instruction.
Qualified expenses do not include expenses for home schooling or for nonathletic supplies for courses in 
health or physical education. Educator expenses also include the cost of personal protective equipment, 
disinfectant, and other supplies used for the prevention of the spread of COVID-19 in the classroom.
You must reduce your qualified expenses by the following amounts.
• Excludable U.S. series EE and I savings bond interest from Form 8815. 
• Nontaxable qualified tuition program earnings. 
• Nontaxable earnings from a Coverdell education savings account (ESA). 
• Any reimbursements you received for these expenses that were not reported to you in 
box 1 of your Form W-2.

 234  •  Chapter 19: Education-Related Adjustments
II. STUDENT LOAN INTEREST DEDUCTION
Generally, personal interest you pay, other than certain mortgage interest, is not deductible on your tax 
return. However, if your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) is less than $95,000 ($195,000 if filing a 
joint return) there is a special deduction allowed for paying interest on a student loan (also known as an 
education loan) used for higher education. For most taxpayers, MAGI is the adjusted gross income as 
figured on their federal income tax return before subtracting any deduction for student loan interest. This 
deduction can reduce the amount of your income subject to tax by up to $2,500. Table 19-1 summarizes 
the features of the student loan interest deduction.

STUDENT LOAN INTEREST DEFINED
Student loan interest is interest you paid during the year on a qualified student loan. It includes both 
required and voluntary interest payments.
Qualified Student Loan
This is a loan you took out solely to pay qualified education expenses (defined later) that were:
• For you, your spouse, or a person who was your dependent (defined in chapter 3) when 
you took out the loan,
• Paid or incurred within a reasonable period of time before or after you took out the loan, 
and
• For education provided during an academic period when the student is an eligible student.

 235  •  Chapter 19: Education-Related Adjustments
Loans from the following sources are not qualified student loans:
• A related person.
• A qualified employer plan.
Reasonable  period  of  time.  Qualified education expenses are treated as paid or incurred within a 
reasonable period of time before or after you take out the loan if they are paid with the proceeds of 
student loans that are part of a federal postsecondary education loan program.
Even if not paid with the proceeds of that type of loan, the expenses are treated as paid or incurred 
within a reasonable period of time if both of the following requirements are met.
1. The expenses relate to a specific academic period, and
2. The loan proceeds are disbursed within a period that begins 90 days before the start of 
that academic period and ends 90 days after the end of that academic period.
If neither of the above situations applies, the reasonable period of time usually is determined based on 
all the relevant facts and circumstances.
Academic  period.  An  academic  period  includes  a  semester,  trimester,  quarter,  or  other  period  of 
study (such as a summer school session) as reasonably determined by an educational institution. If an 
educational institution that uses credit hours or clock hours and does not have academic terms, each 
payment period can be treated as an academic period.
Eligible student. An eligible student is a student who was enrolled at least half-time in a program leading 
to a degree, certificate, or other recognized educational credential.
Enrolled at least half-time. A student was enrolled at least half-time if the student was taking at least 
half the normal full-time work load for his or her course of study.
The standard for what is half of the normal full-time work load is determined by each eligible educational 
institution. However, the standard may not be lower than any of those established by the Department of 
Education under the Higher Education Act of 1965.
Qualified employer plan. You cannot deduct interest on a loan made under a qualified employer plan 
or under a contract purchased under such a plan.
Qualified Education Expenses
Generally, for purposes of the student loan interest deduction, these expenses are the total costs of 
attending an eligible educational institution, including graduate school. They include amounts paid for 
the following items.
• Tuition and fees.
• Room and board.
• Books, supplies, and equipment.

 236  •  Chapter 19: Education-Related Adjustments
• Other necessary expenses (such as transportation).
The cost of room and board qualified only to the extent that it is not more than:
• The allowance for room and board, as determined by the eligible educational institution, 
that  was  included  in  the  cost  of  attendance  (for  federal  financial  aid  purposes)  for  a 
particular academic period and living arrangement of the student.
• If  greater,  the  actual  amount  charged  if  the  student  is  residing  in  housing  owned  or 
operated by the eligible educational institution.
Include as Interest
In addition to simple interest on the loan, if all other requirements are met, the items discussed below 
can be student loan interest. 
Loan origination fee. In general, this is a one-time fee charged by the lender when a loan is made. To 
be deductible as interest, a loan origination fee must be for the use of money rather than for property or 
services (such as commitment fees or processing costs) provided by the lender. A loan origination fee 
treated as interest accrues over the life of the loan.
Capitalized  interest.  This  is  unpaid  interest  on  a  student  loan  that  is  added  by  the  lender  to  the 
outstanding principal balance of the loan.
Interest  on  revolving  lines  of  credit. This  interest,  which  includes  interest  on  credit  card  debt,  is 
student loan interest if the borrower uses the line of credit (credit card) only to pay qualified education 
expenses. See Qualified Education Expenses, earlier.
Interest on refinanced and consolidated student loans. This includes interest on a loan used solely 
to refinance a qualified student loan of the same borrower. It also includes a single consolidation loan 
used solely to refinance two or more qualified student loans of the same borrower.
Caution!
If you refinance a qualified student loan for more than your original loan and you use 
the additional amount for any purpose other than qualified education expenses, you 
cannot deduct any interest paid on the refinanced loan.
Do Not Include as Interest
You cannot claim a student loan interest deduction for any of the following items:
• Interest you paid on a loan if, under the terms of the loan, you are not legally obligated to 
make interest payments.

 237  •  Chapter 19: Education-Related Adjustments
• Loan origination fees that are payments for property or services provided by the lender, 
such as commitment fees or processing costs.
• Interest you paid on a loan to the extent payments were made through your participation 
in  the  National  Health  Service  Corps  Loan  Repayment  Program  (the  “NHSC  Loan  
Repayment Program”) or certain other loan repayment assistance programs.
HOW MUCH CAN YOU DEDUCT
Your student loan interest deduction for 2024 is generally the smaller of:
• $2,500, or
• The interest you paid in 2024.
However, the amount determined above is phased out (gradually reduced) if your MAGI is between 
$80,000 and $95,000 ($165,000 and $195,000 if you file a joint return). You cannot take a student loan 
interest deduction if your MAGI is $95,000 or more ($195,000 or more if you file a joint return). 
III. TUITION AND FEES DEDUCTION
Note
The  tuition  and  fees  deduction  was  repealed  by  the  Further  Consolidated  
Appropriations Act, 2021. However, there are other educational tax-savers available 
in 2024, including the American opportunity credit and the lifetime learning credit 
(discussed in  Chapter 34).

CHAPTER 20: OTHER ADJUSTMENTS TO INCOME
Chapter Objective
After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• Identify  what  business-related  expenses  associated  with  travel,  transportation,  and  gifts  are 
deductible.
I.   WHAT’S NEW/REMINDERS
Deduction for miscellaneous itemized deductions suspended. For tax years beginning after 2017, 
the deduction for job-related or other miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to the 2%-of-adjusted-
gross-income floor is suspended. Armed Forces reservists, qualified performing artists, and fee-based 
state or local government officials can continue to claim eligible business expenses as adjustments in 
determining adjusted gross income. Employees with impairment-related work expenses can continue to 
claim eligible impairment-related work expenses as itemized deductions.
Deduction  for  moving  expenses  suspended. For tax years beginning after 2017, the deduction for 
moving expenses is suspended unless you are a member of the Armed Forces who moves pursuant to 
a military order and incident to a permanent change of station.
Standard  mileage  rate. For 2024, the standard  mileage  rate for the cost of operating  your car for 
business use is 67.0 cents per mile. 
Car expenses and use of the standard mileage rate are explained under Transportation Expenses, later.
Depreciation  limits  on  cars,  trucks,  and  vans.  The  first-year  limit  on  depreciation,  the  special 
depreciation allowance, and the section 179 deduction for vehicles acquired in 2024 is $20,400. If you 
elect not to claim a special depreciation allowance for a vehicle placed in service in 2024, the first-year 
limit is $12,400.
Special depreciation allowance. For 2024, the first-year special (“bonus”) depreciation allowance on 
qualified property (including cars, trucks, and vans) is 60% for qualified property acquired and placed in 
service after December 31, 2023 and before January 1, 2025. 
Meals  and  entertainment. In 2024, entertainment expenses generally are not deductible. Only non-
entertainment-related meals are deductible, and the 50% limitation on the deduction of meals has not 
changed.
II. INTRODUCTION
You may be able to deduct the ordinary and necessary business-related expenses you have for:
• Travel,

 242  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
• Non-entertainment-related meals,
• Gifts, or
• Transportation.
An ordinary expense is one that is common and accepted in your trade or business. A necessary expense 
is one that is helpful and appropriate for your business. An expense does not have to be required to be 
considered necessary.
This chapter explains the following.
• What expenses are deductible.
• How to report your expenses on your return.
• What records you need to prove your expenses.
• How to treat any expense reimbursements you may receive.
Who does not need to use this chapter. The information in this chapter does not apply to you if you 
are an employee and all of the following are true.
• You fully accounted to your employer for your work-related expenses.
• You received full reimbursement for your expenses.
• Your employer required you to return any excess reimbursement and you did so.
• There is no amount shown with a code L in box 12 of your Form W-2, Wage and Tax 
Statement.
If you meet all of these conditions, there is no need to show the expenses or the reimbursements on 
your  return.  See  Reimbursements, later, if you would like more information on reimbursements and 
accounting to your employer.
Tip
 
If you meet these conditions and your employer included reimbursements on your 
Form W-2 in error, ask your employer for a corrected Form W-2.
III. TR AVEL EXPENSES
If you temporarily travel away from your tax home, you can use this section to determine if you have 
deductible travel expenses. This section discusses:
• Traveling away from home,

 243  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
• Tax home,
• Temporary assignment or job, and
• What travel expenses are deductible.
It also discusses the standard meal allowance, rules for travel inside and outside the United States, and 
deductible convention expenses.
Travel expenses defined. For tax purposes, travel expenses are the ordinary and necessary expenses 
(defined earlier) of traveling away from home for your business, profession, or job. You will find examples 
of deductible travel expenses in Table 20-1.
TABLE 20-1. TRAVEL  EXPENSES YOU CAN DEDUCT. 
This chart summarizes expenses you can deduct when you travel away from home for business 
purposes.
IF you have 
expenses for...
THEN you can deduct the cost of...
transportationtravel by airplane, train, bus, or car between your home and your business 
destination. If you were provided with a ticket or you are riding free as 
a result of a frequent traveler or similar program, your cost is zero. If 
you travel by ship, see Luxury  Water  Travel  and  Cruise  Ships  (under  
Conventions) in Pub. 463 for additional rules and limits.
taxi, commuter bus, and 
airport limousine

• The airport or station and your hotel; and
• The hotel and the work location of your customers or clients, your 
business meeting place, or your temporary work location.
baggage and shippingsending baggage and sample or display material between your regular 
and temporary work locations.
caroperating and maintaining your car when traveling away from home on 
business. You can deduct actual expenses or the standard mileage rate 
as well as business-related tolls and parking. If you rent a car while away 
from home on business, you can deduct only the business-use portion of 
the expenses.
lodging and mealsyour lodging and non-entertainment-related meals if your business trip is 
overnight or long enough that you need to stop for sleep or rest to properly 
perform your duties. Meals include amounts spent for food, beverages, 
taxes, and related tips. See Meals and Incidental Expenses, earlier, for 
additional rules and limits.

otherother similar ordinary and necessary expenses related to your business 
travel. These expenses might include transportation to or from a business 
meal, public stenographer’s fees, computer rental fees, and operating 
and maintaining a house trailer.
TRAVELING AWAY FROM HOME
You are traveling away from home if:
• Your duties require you to be away from the general area of your tax home (defined later) 
substantially longer than an ordinary day’s work, and 
• You need to sleep or rest to meet the demands of your work while away from home.
This rest requirement is not satisfied by merely napping in your car. You do not have to be away from 
your tax home for a whole day or from dusk to dawn as long as your relief from duty is long enough to 
get necessary sleep or rest.
Example 1
You are a railroad conductor. You leave your home terminal on a regularly scheduled 
round-trip run between two cities and return home 16 hours later. During the run, you 
have 6 hours off at your turnaround point where you eat two meals and rent a hotel 
room to get necessary sleep before starting the return trip. You are considered to be 
away from home.
Example 2
You are a truck driver. You leave your terminal and return to it later the same day. You 
get an hour off at your turn-around point to eat. Because you are not off to get necessary 
sleep and the brief time off is not an adequate rest period, you are not traveling away 
from home.
Members of the Armed Forces. If you are a member of the U.S. Armed Forces on a permanent duty 
assignment overseas, you are not traveling away from home. You cannot deduct your expenses for 
meals  and  lodging.  You  cannot  deduct  these  expenses  even  if  you  have  to  maintain  a  home  in  the  
United States for your family members who are not allowed to accompany you overseas. If you are 

 245  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
transferred from one permanent duty station to another, you may have deductible moving expenses, 
which are explained in Pub. 521, Moving Expenses.
A naval officer assigned to permanent duty aboard a ship that has regular eating and living facilities has 
a tax home aboard ship for travel expense purposes.
TAX HOME
To determine whether you are traveling away from home, you must first determine the location of your 
tax home.
Generally, your tax home is your regular place of business or post of duty, regardless of where you 
maintain your family home. It includes the entire city or general area in which your business or work is 
located.
If you have more than one regular place of business, your tax home is your main place of business. See 
Main place of business or work, later.
If you do not have a regular or a main place of business because of the nature of your work, then your 
tax home may be the place where you regularly live. See No main place of business or work, later.
If you do not have a regular or a main place of business or post of duty and there is no place where you 
regularly live, you are considered an itinerant (a transient) and your tax home is wherever you work. 
As an itinerant, you cannot claim a travel expense deduction because you are never considered to be 
traveling away from home.
Main place of business or work. If you have more than one place of business or work, consider the 
following when determining which one is your main place of business or work.
• The total time you ordinarily spend in each place.
• The level of your business activity in each place.
• Whether your income from each place is significant or insignificant.
Example
You live in Cincinnati where you have a seasonal job for 8 months each year and earn 
$40,000. You work the other 4 months in Miami, also at a seasonal job, and earn 
$15,000. Cincinnati is your main place of work because you spend most of your time 
there and earn most of your income there.
No main place of business or work. You may have a tax home even if you do not have a regular or 
main place of business or work. Your tax home may be the home where you regularly live.
Factors used to determine tax home. If you do not have a regular or main place of business or work, 
use the following three factors to determine where your tax home is.

 246  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
1. You perform part of your business in the area of your main home and use that home for 
lodging while doing business in the area.
2. You have living expenses at your main home that you duplicate because your business 
requires you to be away from that home.
3. You have not abandoned the area in which both your historical place of lodging and your 
claimed main home are located; you have a member or members of your family living at 
your main home; or you often use that home for lodging.
If you satisfy all three factors, your tax home is the home where you regularly live. If you satisfy only two 
factors, you may have a tax home depending on all the facts and circumstances. If you satisfy only one 
factor, you are an itinerant; your tax home is wherever you work and you cannot deduct travel expenses.
Example
You are single and live in Boston in an apartment you rent. You have worked for your 
employer in Boston for a number of years. Your employer enrolls you in a 12-month 
executive training program. You do not expect to return to work in Boston after you 
complete your training.
During your training, you do not do any work in Boston. Instead, you receive classroom 
and on-the-job training throughout the United States. You keep your apartment in 
Boston and return to it frequently. You use your apartment to conduct your personal 
business. You also keep up your community contacts in Boston. When you complete 
your training, you are transferred to Los Angeles.
You do not satisfy factor (1) because you did not work in Boston. You satisfy factor (2) 
because you had duplicate living expenses. You also satisfy factor (3) because you did 
not abandon your apartment in Boston as your main home, you kept your community 
contacts, and you frequently returned to live in your apartment. Therefore, you have a 
tax home in Boston.
Tax home different from family home. If you (and your family) do not live at your tax home (defined 
earlier), you cannot deduct the cost of traveling between your tax home and your family home. You also 
cannot deduct the cost of meals and lodging while at your tax home. See Example 1 below.
If you are working temporarily in the same city where you and your family live, you may be considered as 
traveling away from home. See Example 2 below.

 247  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
Example 1
You are a truck driver and you and your family live in Tucson. You are employed by a 
trucking firm that has its terminal in Phoenix. At the end of your long runs, you return 
to your home terminal in Phoenix and spend one night there before returning home. 
You cannot deduct any expenses you have for meals and lodging in Phoenix or the cost 
of traveling from Phoenix to Tucson. This is because Phoenix is your tax home.
Example 2
Your family home is in Pittsburgh, where you work 12 weeks a year. The rest of the 
year you work for the same employer in Baltimore. In Baltimore, you eat in restaurants 
and sleep in a rooming house. Your salary is the same whether you are in Pittsburgh or 
Baltimore.
Because you spend most of your working time and earn most of your salary in Baltimore, 
that city is your tax home. You cannot deduct any expenses you have for meals and 
lodging there. However, when you return to work in Pittsburgh, you are away from your 
tax home even though you stay at your family home. You can deduct the cost of your 
round trip between Baltimore and Pittsburgh. You can also deduct your part of your 
family’s living expenses for non-entertainment-related meals and lodging while you are 
living and working in Pittsburgh.
TEMPORARY ASSIGNMENT OR JOB
You may regularly work at your tax home and also work at another location. It may not be practical to 
return to your tax home from this other location at the end of each work day.
Temporary assignment vs. indefinite assignment. If your assignment or job away from your main 
place of work is temporary, your tax home does not change. You are considered to be away from home 
for the whole period you are away from your main place of work. You can deduct your travel expenses if 
they otherwise qualify for deduction. Generally, a temporary assignment in a single location is one that is 
realistically expected to last (and does in fact last) for 1 year or less.
However, if your assignment or job is indefinite, the location of the assignment or job becomes your new 
tax home and you cannot deduct your travel expenses while there. An assignment or job in a single 
location is considered indefinite if it is realistically expected to last for more than 1 year, whether or not it 
actually lasts for more than 1 year.
If your assignment is indefinite, you must include in your income any amounts you receive from your 
employer for living expenses, even if they are called travel allowances and you account to your employer 
for them.

 248  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
Exception  for  federal  crime  investigations  or  prosecutions.  If  you  are  a  federal  employee  
participating in a federal crime investigation or prosecution, you are not subject to the 1-year rule. This 
means you may be able to deduct travel expenses even if you are away from your tax home for more 
than 1 year, provided you meet the other requirements for deductibility.
For you to qualify, the Attorney General (or his or her designee) must certify that you are traveling:
• For the federal government;
• In a temporary duty status; and
• To investigate or prosecute, or provide support services for the investigation or prosecution 
of, a federal crime.
Determining temporary or indefinite. You  must  determine  whether  your  assignment  is  temporary  or  
indefinite when you start work. If you expect an assignment or job to last for 1 year or less, it is temporary 
unless there are facts and circumstances that indicate otherwise. An assignment or job that is initially 
temporary may become indefinite due to changed circumstances. A series of assignments to the same 
location, all for short periods but that together cover a long period, may be considered an indefinite 
assignment.
Going home on days off. If you go back to your tax home from a temporary assignment on your days 
off, you aren’t considered away from home while you are in your hometown. You can’t deduct the cost 
of your meals and lodging there. However, you can deduct your travel expenses, including meals and 
lodging, while traveling between your temporary place of work and your tax home. You can claim these 
expenses up to the amount it would have cost you to stay at your temporary place of work.
If you keep your hotel room during your visit home, you can deduct the cost of your hotel room. In 
addition, you can deduct your expenses of returning home up to the amount you would have spent for 
meals had you stayed at your temporary place of work.
Probationary work period. If you take a job that requires you to move, with the understanding that you 
will keep the job if your work is satisfactory during a probationary period, the job is indefinite. You cannot 
deduct any of your expenses for meals and lodging during the probationary period.
WHAT TRAVEL EXPENSES ARE DEDUCTIBLE?
Once you have determined that you are traveling away from your tax home, you can determine what 
travel expenses are deductible.
You  can  deduct  ordinary  and  necessary  expenses  you  have  when  you  travel  away  from  home  on  
business. The type of expense you can deduct depends on the facts and your circumstances.
Table 20-1 summarizes travel expenses you may be able to deduct. You may have other deductible 
travel expenses that are not covered there, depending on the facts and your circumstances.

 249  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
Tip
When you travel away from home on business, you should keep records of all the 
expenses you have and any advances you receive from your employer. You can use a log, 
diary, notebook, or any other written record to keep track of your expenses. The types 
of expenses you need to record, along with supporting documentation, are described 
in Table 20-2.

Separating costs. If you have one expense that includes the costs of non-entertainment-related meals 
and other services (such as lodging or transportation), you must allocate that expense between the cost 
of non-entertainment-related meals and the cost of other services. You must have a reasonable basis 
for making this allocation. For example, you must allocate your expenses if a hotel includes one or more 
meals in its room charge.
Travel expenses for another individual. If a spouse, dependent, or other individual goes with you (or 
your employee) on a business trip or to a business convention, you generally cannot deduct his or her 
travel expenses.
Employee. You can deduct the travel expenses of someone who goes with you if that person:
1. Is your employee,
2. Has a bona fide business purpose for the travel, and
3. Would otherwise be allowed to deduct the travel expenses.
Business associate. If a business associate travels with you and meets the conditions in (2) and (3) 
above, you can deduct the travel expenses you have for that person. A business associate is someone 
with whom you could reasonably expect to engage or deal in the active conduct of your business. A 
business  associate  can  be  a  current  or  prospective  (likely  to  become)  customer,  client,  supplier, 
employee, agent, partner, or professional advisor.
Bona fide business purpose. A bona fide business purpose exists if you can prove a real business 
purpose for the individual’s presence. Incidental services, such as typing notes or assisting in entertaining 
customers, are not enough to make the expenses deductible.
Example
Jerry  drives  to  Chicago  on  business  and  takes  his  wife,  Linda,  with  him.  Linda  is 
not Jerry’s employee. Linda occasionally types notes, performs similar services, and 
accompanies Jerry to luncheons and dinners. The performance of these services does 
not establish that her presence on the trip is necessary to the conduct of Jerry’s business. 
Her expenses are not deductible.
Jerry pays $199 a day for a double room. A single room costs $149 a day. He can deduct 
the total cost of driving his car to and from Chicago, but only $149 a day for his hotel 
room. If both Jerry and Linda use public transportation, Jerry can deduct only his fare.
Meals and Incidental Expenses 
You can deduct the cost of meals if it is necessary for you to stop for substantial sleep or rest to properly 
perform your duties while traveling away from home on business.

The elimination of the deduction for entertainment expenses is discussed under Meals and Entertainment 
Expenses, later. The following discussion deals with meals (and incidental expenses).
50% limit on meals. You can figure your meal expenses using either of the following methods.
• Actual cost.
• The standard meal allowance.
Both of these methods are explained below. But, regardless of the method you use, you generally can 
deduct only 50% of the unreimbursed cost of your meals.
If you are reimbursed for the cost of your meals, how you apply the 50% limit depends on whether your 
employer’s reimbursement plan was accountable or nonaccountable. If you are not reimbursed, the 50% 
limit applies even if the unreimbursed meal expense is for business travel. The 50% limit is explained 
later under Meals and Entertainment Expenses. Accountable and nonaccountable plans are discussed 
later under Reimbursements.
Actual  cost. You can use the actual cost of your meals to figure the amount of your expense before 
reimbursement and application of the 50% deduction limit. If you use this method, you must keep records 
of your actual cost.
Standard  meal  allowance.  Generally,  you  can  use  the  “standard  meal  allowance”  method  as  an 
alternative to the actual cost method. It allows you to use a set amount for your daily meals and incidental 
expenses (M&IE), instead of keeping records of your actual costs. The set amount varies depending 
on where and when you travel. In this chapter, “standard meal allowance” refers to the federal rate 
for M&IE, discussed later under Amount  of  standard  meal  allowance.  If  you  use  the  standard  meal  
allowance, you still must keep records to prove the time, place, and business purpose of your travel. See 
Recordkeeping, later.
Incidental  expenses. The term “incidental expenses” means fees and tips given to porters, baggage 
carriers, hotel staff, and staff on ships. Incidental expenses do not include expenses for laundry, cleaning 
and pressing of clothing, lodging taxes, costs of telegrams or telephone calls, transportation between 
places of lodging or business and places where meals are taken, or the mailing cost of filing travel 
vouchers and paying employer-sponsored charge card billings.
Incidental-expenses-only  method.  You  can  use  an  optional  method  (instead  of  actual  cost)  for  
deducting incidental expenses only. The amount of the deduction is $5 a day. You can use this method 
only if you did not pay or incur any meal expenses. You cannot use this method on any day that you use 
the standard meal allowance.

 252  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
Caution!
Federal employees should refer to the Federal Travel Regulations at GSA.gov. Find 
“Policy  and  Regulations”  and  click  on  “Regulations”  for  links  to  Federal  Travel 
Regulation (FTR) for changes affecting claims for reimbursement.
50%  limit  may  apply.  If  you  use  the  standard  meal  allowance  method  for  non-entertainment-related  
meal expenses and you are not reimbursed or you are reimbursed under a nonaccountable plan, you can 
generally deduct only 50% of the standard meal allowance. If you are reimbursed under an accountable 
plan and you are deducting amounts that are more than your reimbursements, you can deduct only 
50% of the excess amount. The 50% limit is explained later under Meals and Entertainment Expenses. 
Accountable and nonaccountable plans are discussed later under Reimbursements.
Caution!
 
There is no optional standard lodging amount similar to the standard meal allowance. 
Your allowable lodging expense deduction is your actual cost.
Who can use the standard meal allowance. You can use the standard meal allowance whether you 
are an employee or self-employed, and whether or not you are reimbursed for your traveling expenses.
Use  of  the  standard  meal  allowance  for  other  travel.  You  can  use  the  standard  meal  allowance  to  
figure your meal expenses when you travel in connection with investment and other income-producing 
property. You can also use it to figure your meal expenses when you travel for qualifying educational 
purposes. You cannot use the standard meal allowance to figure the cost of your meals when you travel 
for medical or charitable purposes. 
Amount  of  standard  meal  allowance.  The standard meal allowance is the federal M&IE rate. The 
travel rate for most small localities in the United States is $68 a day. 
Most major cities and many other localities in the United States are designated as high-cost areas, 
qualifying for higher standard meal allowances. You can find this information (organized by year and 
location) on the Internet at GSA.gov/perdiem.
If you travel to more than one location in one day, use the rate in effect for the area where you stop 
for sleep or rest. If you work in the transportation industry, however, see Special rate for transportation 
workers, later.
Standard  meal  allowance  for  areas  outside  the  continental  United  States.  The  standard  meal  
allowance  rates  above  do  not  apply  to  travel  in Alaska,  Hawaii,  or  any  other  location  outside  the 
continental United States. The Department of Defense establishes per diem rates for Alaska, Hawaii, 

 253  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, Midway, the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, 
Wake Island, and other non-foreign areas outside the continental United States. The Department of 
State establishes per diem rates for all other foreign areas.
Note
You can access per diem rates for non-foreign areas outside the continental United 
States at www.Defensetravel.dod.mil/site/perdiemCalc.cfm. You can access all other 
foreign per diem rates at State.gov/travel/. Click on “Travel Per Diem Allowances for 
Foreign Areas” under “Foreign Per Diem Rates” to obtain the latest foreign per diem 
rates.
Special rate for transportation workers. You can use a special standard meal allowance if you work in 
the transportation industry. You are in the transportation industry if your work:
• Directly involves moving people or goods by airplane, barge, bus, ship, train, or truck; and
• Regularly  requires  you  to  travel  away  from  home  and,  during  any  single  trip,  usually 
involves travel to areas eligible for different standard meal allowance rates.
If this applies to you, you can claim a standard daily meal allowance of $69 a day ($74 for travel outside 
the continental United States) for travel in 2024.
Using the special rate for transportation workers eliminates the need for you to determine the standard 
meal allowance for every area where you stop for sleep or rest. If you choose to use the special rate for 
any trip, you must use the special rate (and not use the regular standard meal allowance rates) for all 
trips you take that year.
Travel for days you depart and return. For both the day you depart for and the day you return from a 
business trip, you must prorate the standard meal allowance (figure a reduced amount for each day). 
You can do so by one of two methods.
• Method 1: You can claim 3/4 of the standard meal allowance.
• Method  2:  You  can  prorate  using  any  method  that  you  consistently  apply  and  that  is  in  
accordance with reasonable business practice.
Example
Jen is employed in New Orleans as a convention planner. In March, her employer sent 
her on a 3-day trip to Washington, DC, to attend a planning seminar. She left her home 
in New Orleans at 10 a.m. on Wednesday and arrived in Washington, DC, at 5:30 p.m. 
After spending two nights there, she flew back to New Orleans on Friday and arrived 
back home at 8 p.m. Jen’s employer gave her a flat amount to cover her expenses and 
included it with her wages.

 254  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
Example (continued)
Under Method 1, Jen can claim 2½ days of the standard meal allowance for Washington, 
DC: ¾ of the daily rate for Wednesday and Friday (the days she departed and returned), 
and the full daily rate for Thursday.
Under Method 2, Jen could also use any method that she applies consistently and that 
is in accordance with reasonable business practice. For example, she could claim 3 
days of the standard meal allowance even though a federal employee would have to use 
Method 1 and be limited to only 2½ days.
TRAVEL IN THE UNITED STATES
The  following  discussion  applies  to  travel  in  the  United  States.  For  this  purpose,  the  United  States 
includes only the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The treatment of your travel expenses depends 
on how much of your trip was business related and on how much of your trip occurred within the United 
States. See Part of Trip Outside the United States, later.
Trip Primarily for Business
You  can  deduct  all  your  travel  expenses  if  your  trip  was  entirely  business  related.  If  your  trip  was 
primarily for business and, while at your business destination, you extended your stay for a vacation, 
made a personal side trip, or had other personal activities, you can deduct your business-related travel 
expenses. These expenses include the travel costs of getting to and from your business destination and 
any business-related expenses at your business destination.
Example
You work in Atlanta and take a business trip to New Orleans in May. Your business 
travel totals 900 miles round trip. On your way home, you stop in Mobile to visit your 
parents. You spend $2,165 for the 9 days you are away from home for travel, non-
entertainment-related meals, lodging, and other travel expenses. If you had not stopped 
in Mobile, you would have been gone only 6 days, and your total cost would have been 
$1,633.50. You can deduct $1,633.50 for your trip, including the cost of round-trip 
transportation to and from New Orleans. The deduction for your non-entertainment-
related meals is subject to the 50% limit on meals mentioned earlier.
Trip Primarily for Personal Reasons
If  your  trip  was  primarily  for  personal  reasons,  such  as  a  vacation,  the  entire  cost  of  the  trip  is  a 
nondeductible  personal  expense.  However,  you  can  deduct  any  expenses  you  have  while  at  your 
destination that are directly related to your business.

 255  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
A trip to a resort or on a cruise ship may be a vacation even if the promoter advertises that it is primarily 
for business. The scheduling of incidental business activities during a trip, such as viewing videotapes or 
attending lectures dealing with general subjects, will not change what is really a vacation into a business 
trip.
Part of Trip Outside the United States
If part of your trip is outside the United States, use the rules described later under Travel Outside the 
United States for that part of the trip. For the part of your trip that is inside the United States, use the 
rules for travel in the United States. Travel outside the United States does not include travel from one 
point in the United States to another point in the United States. The following discussion can help you 
determine whether your trip was entirely within the United States.
Public  transportation.  If  you  travel  by  public  transportation,  any  place  in  the  United  States  where 
that vehicle makes a scheduled stop is a point in the United States. Once the vehicle leaves the last 
scheduled stop in the United States on its way to a point outside the United States, you apply the rules 
under Travel Outside the United States, later.
Example
You fly from New York to Puerto Rico with a scheduled stop in Miami. You return to 
New York nonstop. The flight from New York to Miami is in the United States, so only 
the flight from Miami to Puerto Rico is outside the United States. Because there are no 
scheduled stops between Puerto Rico and New York, all of the return trip is outside the 
United States.
Private car. Travel by private car in the United States is travel between points in the United States, even 
when you are on your way to a destination outside the United States.
Example
You travel by car from Denver to Mexico City and return. Your travel from Denver to 
the border and from the border back to Denver is travel in the United States, and the 
rules in this section apply. The rules below under Travel  Outside  the  United  States 
apply to your trip from the border to Mexico City and back to the border.
TRAVEL OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES
If any part of your business travel is outside the United States, some of your deductions for the cost of 
getting to and from your destination may be limited. For this purpose, the United States includes only the 
50 states and the District of Columbia.

 256  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
How much of your travel expenses you can deduct depends in part upon how much of your trip outside 
the United States was business related.
Travel Entirely for Business or Considered Entirely for Business
You can deduct all your travel expenses of getting to and from your business destination if your trip is 
entirely for business or considered entirely for business.
Travel entirely for business. If you travel outside the United States and you spend the entire time on 
business activities, you can deduct all of your travel expenses.
Travel  considered  entirely  for  business.  Even  if  you  did  not  spend  your  entire  time  on  business 
activities, your trip is considered entirely for business if you meet at least one of the following four 
exceptions.
Exception 1—No substantial control. Your trip is considered entirely for business if you did not have 
substantial control over arranging the trip. The fact that you control the timing of your trip does not, by 
itself, mean that you have substantial control over arranging your trip.
You do not have substantial control over your trip if you:
• Are an employee who was reimbursed or paid a travel expense allowance,
• Are not related to your employer, or
• Are not a managing executive.
“Related to your employer” is defined later in this chapter under Per Diem and Car Allowances.
A “managing executive” is an employee who has the authority and responsibility, without being subject to 
the veto of another, to decide on the need for the business travel.
A self-employed person generally has substantial control over arranging business trips.
Exception  2—Outside  United  States  no  more  than  a  week.  Your  trip  is  considered  entirely  for  
business if you were outside the United States for a week or less, combining business and nonbusiness 
activities. One week means 7 consecutive days. In counting the days, do not count the day you leave the 
United States, but do count the day you return to the United States.
Exception  3—Less  than  25%  of  time  on  personal  activities.  Your  trip  is  considered  entirely  for  
business if:
• You were outside the United States for more than a week, and
• You  spent  less  than  25%  of  the  total  time  you  were  outside  the  United  States  on 
nonbusiness activities. 
For this purpose, count both the day your trip began and the day it ended.

 257  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
Exception 4—Vacation not a major consideration. Your trip is considered entirely for business if you 
can establish that a personal vacation wasn’t a major consideration, even if you have substantial control 
over arranging the trip.
Travel Primarily for Business
If you travel outside the United States primarily for business but spend some of your time on nonbusiness 
activities, you generally cannot deduct all of your travel expenses. You only can deduct the business 
portion of your cost of getting to and from your destination. You must allocate the costs between your 
business and nonbusiness activities to determine your deductible amount. 
Tip
You do not have to allocate your travel expense deduction if you meet one of the four 
exceptions listed earlier under Travel considered entirely for business. In those cases, 
you can deduct the total cost of getting to and from your destination.
Travel Primarily for Personal Reasons
If you travel outside the United States primarily for vacation or for investment purposes, the entire cost 
of the trip is a nondeductible personal expense. If you spend some time attending brief professional 
seminars or a continuing education program, you can deduct your registration fees and other expenses 
you have that are directly related to your business.
CONVENTIONS
You can deduct your travel expenses when you attend a convention if you can show that your attendance 
benefits your trade or business. You cannot deduct the travel expenses for your family. If the convention 
is for investment, political, social, or other purposes unrelated to your trade or business, you cannot 
deduct the expenses.
Caution!
Your appointment or election as a delegate does not, in itself, determine whether you 
can deduct travel expenses. You can deduct your travel expenses only if your attendance 
is connected to your own trade or business.

 258  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
Convention agenda. The convention agenda or program generally shows the purpose of the convention. 
You can show your attendance at the convention benefits your trade or business by comparing the 
agenda with the official duties and responsibilities of your position. The agenda does not have to deal 
specifically with your official duties and responsibilities; it will be enough if the agenda is so related to 
your position that it shows your attendance was for business purposes.
Conventions  held  outside  the  North  American  area. See chapter 1 of Pub. 463 for information on 
conventions held outside the North American area.
I V.  MEALS AND ENTERTAINMENT EXPENSES
You  can  no  longer  take  a  deduction  for  any  expense  related  to  activities  generally  considered, 
entertainment, amusement, or recreation. You can continue to deduct 50% of the cost of business meals 
if you (or your employee) is present and the food or beverages are not considered lavish or extravagant. 
Tip
If food or beverages are provided during or at an entertainment event, and the food  
and beverages were purchased separately from the entertainment or the cost of the 
food and beverages was stated separately from the cost of the entertainment on one 
or more bills, invoices, or receipts, you may be able to deduct the separately stated 
costs as a meal expense. For more information, see Regulations section 1.274-11(d)(2), 
Example 2.
50% LIMIT ON MEALS
In general, you can deduct only 50% of your business-related meal, unless an exception applies.  (If you 
are subject to the Department of Transportation’s “hours of service” limits, you can deduct 80% of your 
business-related meal and entertainment expenses. See Individuals subject to “hours of service” limits, 
later.)
Note
The  special  allowance  of  100%  of  your  meal  expenses  if  the  meals  were  food  and 
beverages provided by a restaurant, and paid or incurred during 2021 and 2022 has 
expired.
The  50%  limit  applies  to  employees  or  their  employers,  and  to  self-employed  persons  (including 
independent contractors) or their clients, depending on whether the expenses are reimbursed.

 259  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
Examples of meals might include:
• Meals while traveling away from home (whether eating alone or with others) on business, 
and
• Meals at a business convention or business league meeting.
Included expenses. Taxes and tips relating to a business meal are included as a cost of the meal and 
are subject to the 50% limit. However, the cost of transportation to and from a business meal would not 
be subject to the 50% limit.
Application of 50% limit. The 50% limit on meal expenses applies if the expense is otherwise deductible 
and isn’t covered by one of the exceptions discussed later in this section.
The 50% limit also applies to certain meal expenses that aren’t business related. It applies to meal 
expenses you have for the production of income, including rental or royalty income. It also applies to the 
cost of meals included in deductible educational expenses.
When  to  apply  the  50%  limit.  You  apply  the  50%  limit  after  determining  the  amount  that  would 
otherwise qualify for a deduction. You first have to determine the amount of meal expenses that would 
be deductible under the other rules discussed in this chapter.
Example 1
You spend $200 (including tax and tip) for a business meal. If $110 of that amount is 
not allowable because it is lavish and extravagant, the remaining $90 is subject to the 
50% limit. Your deduction cannot be more than $45 (50% (0.50) × $90).
Example 2
 
You purchase two tickets to a concert for you and your client. Your deduction is zero 
because no deduction is allowed for entertainment expenses.
Figure 20-A can help you determine if the 50% limit applies to you.

 260  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
FIGURE 20-A. DOES THE 50% LIMIT APPLY TO YOUR EXPENSES?
There are exceptions to these rules. See Exceptions to the 50% Limit.
Exceptions to the 50% Limit
Your meal expense is not subject to the 50% limit if the expense meets one of the following exceptions.
Expenses  treated  as  compensation.  In  general,  expenses  for  goods,  services,  and  facilities  are 
not subject to the 50% limit to the extent the expenses are treated by the taxpayer with respect to 
entertainment,  amusement,  or  recreation,  as  compensation  to  an  employee  and  as  wages  to  the 
employee for tax purposes.
Employee’s  reimbursed  expenses. If you are an employee, you are not subject to the 50% limit on 
expenses for which your employer reimburses you under an accountable plan. Accountable plans are 
discussed later under Reimbursements.

 261  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
Individuals  subject  to  “hours  of  service”  limits.  You  can  deduct  a  higher  percentage  of  your  meal  
expenses while traveling away from your tax home if the meals take place during or incident to any 
period subject to the Department of Transportation’s “hours of service” limits. The percentage is 80%.
Individuals subject to the Department of Transportation’s “hours of service” limits include the following 
persons.
• Certain  air  transportation  workers  (such  as  pilots,  crew,  dispatchers,  mechanics,  and 
control tower operators) who are under Federal Aviation Administration regulations.
• Interstate truck operators and bus drivers who are under Department of Transportation 
regulations.
• Certain railroad employees (such as engineers, conductors, train crews, dispatchers, and 
control operations personnel) who are under Federal Railroad Administration regulations.
• Certain merchant mariners who are under Coast Guard regulations.
Other exceptions. There are also exceptions for the self-employed; expenses for recreational, social, or 
similar activities (such as a holiday party); meals furnished as advertising expenses; and selling meals.
V.   GIFT EXPENSES
If you give gifts in the course of your trade or business, you can deduct all or part of the cost. This 
section explains the limits and rules for deducting the costs of gifts.
$25 limit. You can deduct no more than $25 for business gifts you give directly or indirectly to each 
person during your tax year. A gift to a company that is intended for the eventual personal use or benefit 
of a particular person or a limited class of people will be considered an indirect gift to that particular 
person or to the individuals within that class of people who receive the gift.
If you give a gift to a member of a customer’s family, the gift is generally considered to be an indirect gift 
to the customer. This rule does not apply if you have a bona fide independent business connection with 
that family member and the gift is not intended for the customer’s eventual use or benefit.
If you and your spouse both give gifts, both of you are treated as one taxpayer. It does not matter whether 
you have separate businesses, are separately employed, or whether each of you has an independent 
connection with the recipient. If a partnership gives gifts, the partnership and the partners are treated as 
one taxpayer.
Incidental  costs.  Incidental costs, such as engraving on jewelry, or packaging, insuring, and mailing, 
are generally not included in determining the cost of a gift for purposes of the $25 limit.
A cost is incidental only if it does not add substantial value to the gift. For example, the cost of customary 
gift wrapping is an incidental cost. However, the purchase of an ornamental basket for packaging fruit is 
not an incidental cost if the value of the basket is substantial compared to the value of the fruit.

 262  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
Exceptions. The following items are not considered gifts for purposes of the $25 limit.
1. An item that costs $4 or less and:
a) Has your name clearly and permanently imprinted on the gift, and
b) Is one of a number of identical items you widely distribute. Examples include 
pens, desk sets, and plastic bags and cases.
2. Signs, display racks, or other promotional material to be used on the business premises 
of the recipient.
Gift or entertainment. Any item that might be considered either a gift or entertainment generally will be 
considered entertainment. You cannot deduct entertainment expenses. However, if you give a customer 
packaged food or beverages you intend the customer to use at a later date, treat it as a gift.
VI. TR ANSPORTATION EXPENSES
This section discusses expenses you can deduct for business transportation when you are not traveling 
away  from  home  as  defined  earlier  under Travel  Expenses.  These  expenses  include  the  cost  of  
transportation by air, rail, bus, taxi, etc., and the cost of driving and maintaining your car.
Transportation expenses include the ordinary and necessary costs of all of the following.
• Getting from one workplace to another in the course of your business or profession when 
you are traveling within the area of your tax home. (Tax home is defined earlier under 
Travel Expenses.)
• Visiting clients or customers.
• Going to a business meeting away from your regular workplace.
• Getting from your home to a temporary workplace when you have one or more regular 
places of work. These temporary workplaces can be either within the area of your tax 
home or outside that area.
Transportation expenses do not include expenses you have while traveling away from home overnight. 
Those expenses are travel expenses, discussed earlier. However, if you use your car while traveling 
away from home overnight, use the rules in this section to figure your car expense deduction. See Car 
Expenses, later.
Illustration  of  transportation  expenses. Figure 20-B illustrates the rules for when you can deduct 
transportation expenses when you have a regular or main job away from your home. You may want 
to refer to it when deciding whether you can deduct your transportation expenses. Daily transportation 
expenses you incur while traveling from home to one or more regular places of business are generally 
nondeductible commuting expenses. However, there are many exceptions for deducting transportation 
expenses, like whether your work location is temporary (inside or outside the metropolitan area), traveling 
for the same trade or business, or if you have a home office.

 263  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
FIGURE 20-B. WHEN ARE TRANSPORTATION EXPENSES DEDUCTIBLE?
Most  employees  and  self-employed  persons  can  use  this  chart.  (Don’t  use  this  chart  if  your  home  is  your  principal  place  of  
business. See (Office in the home.)
Temporary work location. If you have one or more regular work locations away from your home and 
you commute to a temporary work location in the same trade or business, you can deduct the expenses 
of  the  daily  round-trip  transportation  between  your  home  and  the  temporary  location,  regardless  of 
distance.
If your employment at a work location is realistically expected to last (and does in fact last) for 1 year 
or less, the employment is temporary unless there are facts and circumstances that would indicate 
otherwise.
If your employment at a work location is realistically expected to last for more than 1 year or if there is 
no realistic expectation that the employment will last for 1 year or less, the employment is not temporary, 
regardless of whether it actually lasts for more than 1 year.

 264  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
If employment at a work location initially is realistically expected to last for 1 year or less, but at some 
later date the employment is realistically expected to last more than 1 year, that employment will be 
treated as temporary (unless there are facts and circumstances that would indicate otherwise) until your 
expectation changes. It will not be treated as temporary after the date you determine it will last more 
than 1 year.
If the temporary work location is beyond the general area of your regular place of work and you stay 
overnight, you are traveling away from home. You may have deductible travel expenses as discussed 
earlier in this chapter.
No regular place of work. If you have no regular place of work but ordinarily work in the metropolitan 
area where you live, you can deduct daily transportation costs between home and a temporary work site 
outside that metropolitan area.
Generally, a metropolitan area includes the area within the city limits and the suburbs that are considered 
part of that metropolitan area.
You cannot deduct daily transportation costs between your home and temporary work sites within your 
metropolitan area. These are nondeductible commuting expenses.
Two  places  of  work. If you work at two places in one day, whether or not for the same employer, 
you can deduct the expense of getting from one workplace to the other. However, if for some personal 
reason you do not go directly from one location to the other, you cannot deduct more than the amount it 
would have cost you to go directly from the first location to the second.
Transportation expenses you have in going between home and a part-time job on a day off from your 
main job are commuting expenses. You cannot deduct them.
Armed Forces reservists. A meeting of an Armed Forces reserve unit is a second place of business 
if the meeting is held on a day on which you work at your regular job. You can deduct the expense of 
getting from one workplace to the other as just discussed under Two places of work, earlier.
You usually cannot deduct the expense if the reserve meeting is held on a day on which you do not work 
at your regular job. In this case, your transportation generally is a nondeductible commuting expense. 
However, you can deduct your transportation expenses if the location of the meeting is temporary and 
you have one or more regular places of work.
If you ordinarily work in a particular metropolitan area but not at any specific location and the reserve 
meeting is held at a temporary location outside that metropolitan area, you can deduct your transportation 
expenses.
If you travel away from home overnight to attend a guard or reserve meeting, you can deduct your travel 
expenses. These expenses are discussed earlier under Travel Expenses.

 265  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
If you travel more than 100 miles away from home in connection with your performance of services as 
a member of the reserves, you may be able to deduct some of your reserve-related travel costs as an 
adjustment to income rather than as an itemized deduction. See Armed Forces reservists traveling more 
than 100 miles from home under Special Rules, later.
Commuting expenses. You cannot deduct the costs of taking a bus, trolley, subway, or taxi, or of driving 
a car between your home and your main or regular place of work. These costs are personal commuting 
expenses. You cannot deduct commuting expenses no matter how far your home is from your regular 
place of work. You cannot deduct commuting expenses even if you work during the commuting trip.
Example
You sometimes use your cell phone to make business calls while commuting to and from 
work. Sometimes business associates ride with you to and from work, and you have a 
business discussion in the car. These activities do not change the trip from personal to 
business. You cannot deduct your commuting expenses.
Parking  fees. Fees you pay to park your car at your place of business are nondeductible commuting 
expenses. You can, however, deduct business-related parking fees when visiting a customer or client.
Advertising display on car. Putting display material that advertises your business on your car does not 
change the use of your car from personal use to business use. If you use this car for commuting or other 
personal uses, you still cannot deduct your expenses for those uses.
Car pools. You cannot deduct the cost of using your car in a nonprofit car pool. Do not include payments 
you  receive  from  the  passengers  in  your  income. These  payments  are  considered  reimbursements 
of your expenses. However, if you operate a car pool for a profit, you must include payments from 
passengers in your income. You can then deduct your car expenses (using the rules in this chapter).
Hauling tools or instruments. Hauling tools or instruments in your car while commuting to and from 
work does not make your car expenses deductible. However, you can deduct any additional costs you 
have for hauling tools or instruments (such as for renting a trailer you tow with your car).
Union members’ trips from a union hall. If you get your work assignments at a union hall and then 
go to your place of work, the costs of getting from the union hall to your place of work are nondeductible 
commuting expenses. Although you need the union to get your work assignments, you are employed 
where you work, not where the union hall is located.
Office in the home. If you have an office in your home that qualifies as a principal place of business, 
you can deduct your daily transportation costs between your home and another work location in the 
same trade or business. (See Pub. 587 for information on determining if your home office qualifies as a 
principal place of business.)

 266  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
Examples  of  deductible  transportation.  The  following  examples  show  when  you  can  deduct  
transportation expenses based on the location of your work and your home.
Example 1
You regularly work in an office in the city where you live. Your employer sends you to 
a 1-week training session at a different office in the same city. You travel directly from 
your home to the training location and return each day. You can deduct the cost of your 
daily round-trip transportation between your home and the training location.
Example 2
Your principal place of business is in your home. You can deduct the cost of round-
trip transportation between your qualifying home office and your client’s or customer’s 
place of business.
Example 3
You have no regular office, and you do not have an office in your home. In this case, 
the location of your first business contact inside the metropolitan area is considered 
your office. Transportation expenses between your home and this first contact are 
nondeductible  commuting  expenses.  Transportation  expenses  between  your  last 
business contact and your home are also nondeductible commuting expenses. While 
you cannot deduct the costs of these first and last trips, you can deduct the costs of 
going from one client or customer to another. 
CAR EXPENSES
If you use your car for business purposes, you may be able to deduct car expenses. You generally can 
use one of the following two methods to figure your deductible expenses.
• Standard Mileage Rate.
• Actual Car Expenses.
If you use actual car expenses to figure your deduction for a car you lease, there are rules that affect the 
amount of your lease payments you can deduct. See Leasing a car under Actual Car Expenses, later.
In this chapter, the term “car” includes a van, pickup, or panel truck.

 267  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
Standard Mileage Rate
You may be able to use the standard mileage rate to figure the deductible costs of operating your car for 
business purposes. For 2024, the standard mileage rate for business use is 67.0 cents (0.67) per mile. 
Caution!
 
If you use the standard mileage rate for a year, you cannot deduct your actual car 
expenses for that year, but see Parking fees and tolls, later.
You generally can use the standard mileage rate whether or not you are reimbursed and whether or 
not any reimbursement is more or less than the amount figured using the standard mileage rate. See 
Reimbursements under How To Report, later.
Choosing the standard mileage rate. If you want to use the standard mileage rate for a car you own, 
you must choose to use it in the first year the car is available for use in your business. Then, in later 
years, you can choose to use either the standard mileage rate or actual expenses.
If you want to use the standard mileage rate for a car you lease, you must use it for the entire lease 
period.
You must make the choice to use the standard mileage rate by the due date (including extensions) of 
your return. You cannot revoke the choice. However, in a later year, you can switch from the standard 
mileage  rate  to  the  actual  expenses  method.  If  you  change  to  the  actual  expenses  method  in  a  later  
year, but before your car is fully depreciated, you have to estimate the remaining useful life of the car 
and use straight line depreciation.
For more information about depreciation included in the standard mileage rate, see the exception in 
Methods of depreciation under Depreciation Deduction in chapter 4 of Pub. 463.
Standard mileage rate not allowed. You can’t use the standard mileage rate if you:
• Use five or more cars at the same time (as in fleet operations),
• Claimed  a  depreciation  deduction  for  the  car  using  any  method  other  than  straight  line  
depreciation,
• Claimed a section 179 deduction on the car,
• Claimed the special depreciation allowance on the car, or
• Claimed actual car expenses after 1997 for a car you leased.

 268  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
Five or more cars. If you own or lease five or more cars that are used for business at the same time, 
you can’t use the standard mileage rate for the business use of any car. However, you may be able to 
deduct your actual expenses for operating each of the cars in your business. See Actual Car Expenses 
in chapter 4 of Pub. 463 for information on how to figure your deduction.
You are not using five or more cars for business at the same time if you alternate using (use at different 
times) the cars for business.
Parking fees and tolls. In addition to using the standard mileage rate, you can deduct any business-
related  parking  fees  and  tolls.  (Parking  fees  you  pay  to  park  your  car  at  your  place  of  work  are 
nondeductible commuting expenses.)
Actual Car Expenses
If you do not use the standard mileage rate, you may be able to deduct your actual car expenses.
Tip
 
If you qualify to use both methods, you may want to figure your deduction both ways to 
see which gives you a larger deduction.
Actual car expenses include:
DepreciationLease paymentsRegistration fees
LicensesInsuranceRepairs
GasGarage rentTires
OilParking feesTolls
Business and personal use. If you use your car for both business and personal purposes, you must 
divide your expenses between business and personal use. You can divide your expenses based on the 
miles driven for each purpose. 
Example
You are a contractor and drive your car 20,000 miles during the year: 12,000 miles 
for business use and 8,000 miles for personal use. You can claim only 60% (12,000 ÷ 
20,000) of the cost of operating your car as a business expense.
Interest on car loans. If you are an employee, you cannot deduct any interest paid on a car loan. This 
interest is treated as personal interest and is not deductible. However, if you are self-employed and use 
your car in that business, see chapter 4 of Pub. 535.

 269  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
Taxes paid on your car. If you are an employee, you can deduct personal property taxes paid on your 
car if you itemize deductions. Enter the amount paid on line 5c of Schedule A (Form 1040). (See chapter 
23 for more information on taxes.) If you are not an employee, see your form instructions for information 
on how to deduct personal property taxes paid on your car.
Sales taxes. Generally, sales taxes on your car are part of your car’s basis and are recovered through 
depreciation, discussed later.
Fines and collateral. You cannot deduct fines you pay and collateral you forfeited for traffic violations.
Depreciation  and  section  179  deductions.  Generally,  the  cost  of  a  car,  plus  sales  tax  and 
improvements, is a capital expense. Because the benefits last longer than 1 year, you generally cannot 
deduct a capital expense. However, you can recover this cost through the section 179 deduction and 
depreciation deductions. Depreciation allows you to recover the cost over more than 1 year by deducting 
part of it each year. The section 179 deduction and the  depreciation deductions are discussed in more 
detail in chapter 4 of Pub. 463.
Generally, there are limits on these deductions. Special rules apply if you use your car 50% or less in 
your work or business.
Leasing a car. If you lease a car, truck, or van that you use in your business, you can use the standard 
mileage rate or actual expenses to figure your deductible car expense.
Deductible  payments. If you choose to use actual expenses, you can deduct the part of each lease 
payment that is for the use of the vehicle in your business. You cannot deduct any part of a lease 
payment that is for personal use of the vehicle, such as commuting.
You must spread any advance payments over the entire lease period. You cannot deduct any payments 
you make to buy a vehicle, even if the payments are called lease payments.
If you lease a car, truck, or van for 30 days or more, you may have to reduce your lease payment 
deduction by an “inclusion amount.” For information on reporting lease inclusion amounts, see Leasing 
a Car in chapter 4 of Pub. 463.
Disposition of a Car
If you dispose of your car, you may have a taxable gain or a deductible loss. This is true whether you 
used the standard mileage rate or actual car expenses to deduct the business use of your car. Pub. 
544 has information on sales of property used in a trade or business, and details on how to report the 
disposition.

 270  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
VII. RECORDKEEPING
If you deduct travel, gift, or transportation expenses, you must be able to prove (substantiate) certain 
elements of the expense. This section discusses the records you need to keep to prove these expenses.
Tip
If you keep timely and accurate records, you will have support to show the IRS if your  
tax return is ever examined. You will also have proof of expenses that your employer 
may require if you are reimbursed under an accountable plan. These plans  are discussed 
later under Reimbursements.
HOW TO PROVE EXPENSES
Table 20-2 is a summary of records you need to prove each expense discussed in this chapter. You must 
be able to prove the elements listed across the top portion of the table. You prove them by having the 
information and receipts (where needed) for the expenses listed in the first column.
Caution!
 
You cannot deduct amounts that you approximate or estimate.
You should keep adequate records to prove your expenses or have sufficient evidence that will support 
your own statement. You must generally prepare a written record for it to be considered adequate. This 
is because written evidence is more reliable than oral evidence alone.
Tip
 
However, if you contemporaneously prepare a record on a computer, it is considered 
an adequate record.
What Are Adequate Records?
You should keep the proof you need in an account book, diary, statement of expense, or similar record. 
You should also keep documentary evidence that, together with your records, will support each element 
of an expense.

 271  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
Documentary evidence. You generally must have documentary evidence, such as receipts, canceled 
checks, or bills, to support your expenses.
Exception. Documentary evidence is not needed if any of the following conditions apply.
• You  have  meals  or  lodging  expenses  while  traveling  away  from  home  for  which  you  
account to your employer under an accountable plan and you use a per diem allowance 
method that includes meals and/or lodging. (Accountable plans and per diem allowances 
are discussed later under Reimbursements.)
• Your expense, other than lodging, is less than $75.
• You have a transportation expense for which a receipt is not readily available.
Adequate  evidence.  Documentary  evidence  ordinarily  will  be  considered  adequate  if  it  shows  the 
amount, date, place, and essential character of the expense.
For example, a hotel receipt is enough to support expenses for business travel if it has all of the following 
information.
• The name and location of the hotel.
• The dates you stayed there.
• Separate amounts for charges such as lodging, meals, and telephone calls.
A restaurant receipt is enough to prove an expense for a business meal if it has all of the following 
information.
• The name and location of the restaurant.
• The number of people served.
• The date and amount of the expense.
If a charge is made for items other than food and beverages, the receipt must show that this is the case.
Canceled check. A canceled check, together with a bill from the payee, ordinarily establishes the cost. 
However, a canceled check by itself does not prove a business expense without other evidence to show 
that it was for a business purpose.
Duplicate information. You do not have to record information in your account book or other record that 
duplicates information shown on a receipt as long as your records and receipts complement each other 
in an orderly manner.
You  do  not  have  to  record  amounts  your  employer  pays  directly  for  any  ticket  or  other  travel  item. 
However, if you charge these items to your employer, through a credit card or otherwise, you must keep 
a record of the amounts you spend.

 272  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
Timely kept records. You should record the elements of an expense or of a business use at or near the 
time of the expense or use and support it with sufficient documentary evidence. A timely kept record has 
more value than a statement prepared later when generally there is a lack of accurate recall.
You do not need to write down the elements of every expense on the day of the expense. If you maintain 
a log on a weekly basis which accounts for use during the week, the log is considered a timely kept 
record.
If you give your employer, client, or customer an expense account statement, it can also be considered 
a timely kept record. This is true if you copy it from your account book, diary, statement of expense, or 
similar record.
Proving business purpose. You must generally provide a written statement of the business purpose 
of an expense. However, the degree of proof varies according to the circumstances in each case. If the 
business purpose of an expense is clear from the surrounding circumstances, then you don’t need to 
give a written explanation.
Confidential information. You do not need to put confidential information relating to an element of a 
deductible expense (such as the place, business purpose, or business relationship) in your account 
book, diary, or other record. However, you do have to record the information elsewhere at or near the 
time of the expense and have it available to fully prove that element of the expense.
What If I Have Incomplete Records?
If you do not have complete records to prove an element of an expense, then you must prove the 
element with:
• Your own written or oral statement, containing specific information about the element; and
• Other supporting evidence that is sufficient to establish the element.
Destroyed records. If you cannot produce a receipt because of reasons beyond your control, you can 
prove a deduction by reconstructing your records or expenses. Reasons beyond your control include 
fire, flood, and other casualties.
Separating and Combining Expenses
This section explains when expenses must be kept separate and when expenses can be combined.
Separating  expenses.  Each  separate  payment  is  generally  considered  a  separate  expense.  For 
example, if you travel to a business meeting and have a non-entertainment-related meal, you have two 
separate expenses. You must record them separately in your records.
Combining items. You can make one daily entry in your record for reasonable categories of expenses. 
Examples  are  taxi  fares,  telephone  calls,  or  other  incidental  travel  costs.  Non-entertainment-related 
meals should be in a separate category. You can include tips for meal-related services with the costs of 
the meals.

 273  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
Expenses  of  a  similar  nature  occurring  during  the  course  of  a  single  event  are  considered  a  single  
expense.
Allocating total cost. If you can prove the total cost of travel but you cannot prove how much it cost for 
each person who participated in the event, you may have to allocate the total cost among you and your 
guests on a pro rata basis. An allocation would be needed, for example, if you did not have a business 
relationship with all of your guests.
If your return is examined. If your return is examined, you may have to provide additional information 
to  the  IRS. This  information  could  be  needed  to  clarify  or  to  establish  the  accuracy  or  reliability  of 
information  contained  in  your  records,  statements,  testimony,  or  documentary  evidence  before  a 
deduction is allowed.
HOW LONG TO KEEP RECORDS AND RECEIPTS
You must keep records as long as they may be needed for the administration of any provision of the 
Internal Revenue Code. Generally, this means you must keep your records that support your deduction 
(or an item of income) for 3 years from the date you file the income tax return on which the deduction is 
claimed. A return filed early is considered filed on the due date. For a more complete explanation, see 
Pub. 583, Starting a Business and Keeping Records.
Reimbursed  for  expenses.  Employees  who  give  their  records  and  documentation  to  their  employers  
and are reimbursed for their expenses generally don’t have to keep copies of this information. However, 
you may have to prove your expenses if any of the following conditions apply.
• You claim deductions for expenses that are more than reimbursements.
• Your expenses are reimbursed under a nonaccountable plan.
• Your employer does not use adequate accounting procedures to verify expense accounts.
• You are related to your employer, as defined later under Related to employer.
See the next section, How  To  Report, for a discussion of reimbursements, adequate accounting, and 
nonaccountable plans.
VIII. HOW TO REPORT
This  section  explains  where  and  how  to  report  the  expenses  discussed  in  this  chapter.  It  discusses  
reimbursements and how to treat them under accountable and nonaccountable plans. It also explains 
rules for independent contractors and clients, fee-basis officials, certain performing artists, Armed Forces 
reservists, and certain disabled employees. This section ends with an illustration of how to report travel, 
gift, and car expenses on Form 2106.

 274  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
Self-employed. You must report your income and expenses on Schedule C (Form 1040) if you are a 
sole proprietor, or on Schedule F (Form 1040) if you are a farmer. You do not use Form 2106. See your 
form instructions for information on how to complete your tax return. You can also find information in 
Pub. 535 if you are a sole proprietor, or in Pub. 225, Farmer’s Tax Guide, if you are a farmer.
Both self-employed and an employee. If you are both self-employed and an employee, you must keep 
separate records for each business activity. Report your business expenses for self-employment on 
Schedule C or F (Form 1040), as discussed earlier. Report your business expenses for your work as an 
employee on Form 2106, as discussed next.
Caution!
Form 2106 is only used by Armed Forces reservists, qualified performing artists, fee-
based state or local government officials, and employees with impairment-related work 
expenses. Due to the suspension of miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to the 
2% floor under section 67(a), employees who do not fit into one of the listed categories 
may not use Form 2106.
Employees. If you are an employee, you generally must complete Form 2106 to deduct your travel and 
transportation expenses.
For more information on how to report your expenses on Form 2106, see Completing Form 2106, later.
Statutory  employees.  If you received a Form W-2 and the “Statutory employee” box in box 13 was 
checked, report your income and expenses related to that income on Schedule C (Form 1040). Do not 
complete Form 2106.
Statutory employees include full-time life insurance salespersons, certain agent or commission drivers, 
traveling salespersons, and certain homeworkers.
Caution!
If you are entitled to a reimbursement from your employer but you do not claim it, you 
cannot claim a deduction for the expenses to which that unclaimed reimbursement 
applies.
Reimbursement for personal expenses. If your employer reimburses you for nondeductible personal 
expenses, such as for vacation trips, your employer must report the reimbursement as wage income in 
box 1 of your Form W-2. You cannot deduct personal expenses.

 275  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
REIMBURSEMENTS
This section explains what to do when you receive an advance or are reimbursed for any of the employee 
business expenses discussed in this chapter.
If you received an advance, allowance, or reimbursement for your expenses, how you report this amount 
and your expenses depends on whether your employer reimbursed you under an accountable plan or a 
nonaccountable plan.
This section explains the two types of plans, how per diem and car allowances simplify proving the 
amount of your expenses, and the tax treatment of your reimbursements and expenses.
No reimbursement. You are not reimbursed or given an allowance for your expenses if you are paid a 
salary or commission with the understanding that you will pay your own expenses. In this situation, you 
have no reimbursement or allowance arrangement, and this section on reimbursements does not apply 
to you. Instead, see Completing Form 2106, later, for information on completing your tax return.
Reimbursement, allowance, or advance. A reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement 
is a system or plan that an employer uses to pay, substantiate, and recover the expenses, advances, 
reimbursements, and amounts charged to the employer for employee business expenses. Arrangements 
include per diem and car allowances.
A per diem allowance is a fixed amount of daily reimbursement your employer gives you for your lodging, 
meal,  and  incidental  expenses  when  you  are  away  from  home  on  business.  (The  term  “incidental 
expenses” is defined earlier under Meals and Incidental Expenses.) A car allowance is an amount your 
employer gives you for the business use of your car. 
Your  employer  should  tell  you  what  method  of  reimbursement  is  used  and  what  records  you  must 
provide.
Accountable Plans
To be an accountable plan, your employer’s reimbursement or allowance arrangement must include all 
of the following rules.
1. Your expenses must have a business connection—that is, you must have paid or incurred 
deductible expenses while performing services as an employee of your employer.
2. You must adequately account to your employer for these expenses within a reasonable 
period of time.
3. You must return any excess reimbursement or allowance within a reasonable period of 
time.
See Adequate Accounting and Returning Excess Reimbursements, later.

 276  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
An excess reimbursement or allowance is any amount you are paid that is more than the business-
related expenses that you adequately accounted for to your employer.
Reasonable  period  of  time.  The definition of a reasonable period of time depends on the facts and 
circumstances of your situation. However, regardless of the facts and circumstances of your situation, 
actions that take place within the times specified in the following list will be treated as taking place within 
a reasonable period of time.
• You receive an advance within 30 days of the time you have an expense.
• You adequately account for your expenses within 60 days after they were paid or incurred.
• You return any excess reimbursement within 120 days after the expense was paid or 
incurred.
• You are given a periodic statement (at least quarterly) that asks you to either return or 
adequately  account  for  outstanding  advances  and  you  comply  within  120  days  of  the  
statement.
Employee  meets  accountable  plan  rules. If you meet the three rules for accountable plans, your 
employer should not include any reimbursements in your income in box 1 of your Form W-2. If your 
expenses equal your reimbursement, you do not complete Form 2106. You have no deduction since 
your expenses and reimbursement are equal.
Tip
 
If your employer included reimbursements in box 1 of your Form W-2 and you meet all 
the rules for accountable plans, ask your employer for a corrected Form W-2.
Accountable plan rules not met. Even though you are reimbursed under an accountable plan, some of 
your expenses may not meet all the rules. Those expenses that fail to meet all three rules for accountable 
plans are treated as having been reimbursed under a nonaccountable plan (discussed later).
Reimbursement  of  nondeductible  expenses.  You  may  be  reimbursed  under  your  employer’s 
accountable plan for expenses related to that employer’s business, some of which are deductible as 
employee business expenses and some of which are not deductible. The reimbursements you receive 
for the nondeductible expenses do not meet rule (1) for accountable plans, and they are treated as paid 
under a nonaccountable plan.

 277  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
Example
Your employer’s plan reimburses you for travel expenses while away from home on 
business and also for meals when you work late at the office, even though you are not 
away from home. The part of the arrangement that reimburses you for the nondeductible 
meals when you work late at the office is treated as paid under a nonaccountable plan.
Tip
The employer makes the decision whether to reimburse employees under an accountable 
plan or a nonaccountable plan. If you are an employee who receives payments under 
a  nonaccountable  plan,  you  cannot  convert  these  amounts  to  payments  under  an 
accountable plan by voluntarily accounting to your employer for the expenses and 
voluntarily returning excess reimbursements to the employer.
Adequate Accounting
One of the rules for an accountable plan is that you must adequately account to your employer for your 
expenses. You adequately account by giving your employer a statement of expense, an account book, 
a diary, or a similar record in which you entered each expense at or near the time you had it, along 
with documentary evidence (such as receipts) of your travel, mileage, and other employee business 
expenses. (See Table 20-2 for details you need to enter in your record and documents you need to 
prove certain expenses.) A per diem or car allowance satisfies the adequate accounting requirement 
under certain conditions. See Per Diem and Car Allowances, later.
You  must  account  for  all  amounts  you  received  from  your  employer  during  the  year  as  advances, 
reimbursements, or allowances. This includes amounts you charged to your employer by credit card or 
other method. You must give your employer the same type of records and supporting information that 
you would have to give to the IRS if the IRS questioned a deduction on your return. You must pay back 
the amount of any reimbursement or other expense allowance for which you do not adequately account 
or that is more than the amount for which you accounted.
Per Diem and Car Allowances
If your employer reimburses you for your expenses using a per diem or car allowance, you can generally 
use the allowance as proof of the amount of your expenses. A per diem or car allowance satisfies the 
adequate accounting requirements for the amount of your expenses only if all the following conditions 
apply.
• Your employer reasonably limits payments of your expenses to those that are ordinary 
and necessary in the conduct of the trade or business.
• The allowance is similar in form to and not more than the federal rate (discussed later).

 278  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
• You  prove  the  time  (dates),  place,  and  business  purpose  of  your  expenses  to  your 
employer (as explained in Table 20-2) within a reasonable period of time.
• You are not related to your employer (as defined next). If you are related to your employer, 
you must be able to prove your expenses to the IRS even if you have already adequately 
accounted to your employer and returned any excess reimbursement.
If the IRS finds that an employer’s travel allowance practices are not based on reasonably accurate 
estimates  of  travel  costs  (including  recognition  of  cost  differences  in  different  areas  for  per  diem 
amounts), you will not be considered to have accounted to your employer. In this case, you must be able 
to prove your expenses to the IRS.
Related to employer. You are related to your employer if:
1. Your employer is your brother or sister, half brother or half sister, spouse, ancestor, or 
lineal descendant;
2. Your employer is a corporation in which you own, directly or indirectly, more than 10% in 
value of the outstanding stock; or
3. Certain relationships (such as grantor, fiduciary, or beneficiary) exist between you, a trust, 
and your employer.
You may be considered to indirectly own stock, for purposes of (2), if you have an interest in a corporation, 
partnership, estate, or trust that owns the stock or if a member of your family or your partner owns the 
stock.
The federal rate. The federal rate can be figured using any one of the following methods.
1. For per diem amounts:
a) The regular federal per diem rate.
b) The standard meal allowance.
c) The high-low rate.
2. For car expenses:
a) The standard mileage rate.
b) A fixed and variable rate (FAVR).
Tip
 
For per diem amounts, use the rate in effect for the area where you stop for sleep or rest.

 279  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
Regular federal per diem rate. The regular federal per diem rate is the highest amount that the federal 
government will pay to its employees for lodging, meal, and incidental expenses (or meal and incidental 
expenses only) while they are traveling away from home in a particular area. The rates are different for 
different locations. Your employer should have these rates available. (They are also available at GSA.
gov/travel/plan-book/per-diem-rates.)
The standard meal allowance. The standard meal allowance (discussed earlier) is the federal rate for 
meals and incidental expenses (M&IE). For travel in 2024, the rate for most small localities in the United 
States is $68 a day. Most major cities and many other localities qualify for higher rates. You can find this 
information at GSA.gov/travel/plan-book/per-diem-rates.
You receive an allowance only for meals and incidental expenses when your employer does one of the 
following.
• Provides you with lodging (furnishes it in kind).
• Reimburses you, based on your receipts, for the actual cost of your lodging.
• Pays the hotel, motel, etc., directly for your lodging.
• Does not have a reasonable belief that you had (or will have) lodging expenses, such as 
when you stay with friends or relatives or sleep in the cab of your truck.
• Figures the allowance on a basis similar to that used in figuring your compensation, such 
as number of hours worked or miles traveled.
High-low  rate. This is a simplified method of figuring the federal per diem rate for travel within the 
continental United States. It eliminates the need to keep a current list of the per diem rate for each city.
Under the high-low method, the per diem amount for travel in 2024 beginning October 1 is $319 for 
certain high-cost locations. All other areas have a per diem amount of $225.
Prorating the standard meal allowance on partial days of travel. The standard meal allowance is for 
a full 24-hour day of travel. If you travel for part of a day, such as on the days you depart and return, you 
must prorate the full-day M&IE rate. This rule also applies if your employer uses the regular federal per 
diem rate or the high-low rate.
You can use either of the following methods to figure the federal M&IE for that day.
1. Method 1:
a) For the day you depart, add ¾ of the standard meal allowance amount for 
that day.
b) For the day you return, add ¾ of the standard meal allowance amount for the 
preceding day.
2. Method 2: Prorate the standard meal allowance using any method you consistently apply 
in accordance with reasonable business practice.

The standard mileage rate. This is a set rate per mile that you can use to figure your deductible car 
expenses. For 2024, the standard mileage rate for the cost of operating your car is 67.0 cents (0.67) per 
mile. 
Fixed  and  variable  rate  (FAVR).  This is an allowance your employer may use to reimburse your car 
expenses. Under this method, your employer pays an allowance that includes a combination of payments 
covering fixed and variable costs, such as a cents-per-mile rate to cover your variable operating costs 
(such as gas, oil, etc.) plus a flat amount to cover your fixed costs (such as depreciation (or lease 
payments), insurance, etc.). If your employer chooses to use this method, your employer will request the 
necessary records from you.
Reporting your expenses with a per diem or car allowance. If your reimbursement is in the form of 
an allowance received under an accountable plan, the following facts affect your reporting.
• The federal rate.
• Whether the allowance or your actual expenses were more than the federal rate.
The  following  discussions  explain  where  to  report  your  expenses  depending  upon  how  the  amount  of  
your allowance compares to the federal rate.
Allowance less than or equal to the federal rate. If your allowance is less than or equal to the federal 
rate, the allowance will not be included in box 1 of your Form W-2. You do not need to report the related 
expenses or the allowance on your return if your expenses are equal to or less than the allowance.
However, if your actual expenses are more than your allowance, you can complete Form 2106 and 
deduct the excess amount if you are an Armed Forces reservist, fee-based state or local government 
official, qualified performing artist, or disabled employee with impairment-related work expenses. If you 
are using actual expenses, you must be able to prove to the IRS the total amount of your expenses 
and reimbursements for the entire year. If you are using the standard meal allowance or the standard 
mileage rate, you don’t have to prove that amount.
Example
Nicole, a fee-basis state government official, drives 10,000 miles in 2024 for business. 
Under her employer’s accountable plan, she accounts for the time (dates), place, and 
business purpose of each trip. Her employer pays her a mileage allowance of 40 cents 
(0.40) a mile.
Since Nicole’s $6,700 expense figured under the standard mileage rate (10,000 miles 
x 67.0 cents (0.67)) is more than her $4,000 reimbursement (10,000 miles × 40 cents 
(0.40)), she itemizes her deductions to claim the excess expense. Nicole completes 
Form 2106 (showing all her expenses and reimbursements) and enters $2,700 ($6,700 
− $4,000) as an itemized deduction.

 281  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
Allowance more than the federal rate. If your allowance is more than the federal rate, your employer 
must include the allowance amount up to the federal rate under code L in box 12 of your Form W-2. This 
amount is not taxable. However, the excess allowance will be included in box 1 of your Form W-2. You 
must report this part of your allowance as if it were wage income.
If your actual expenses are less than or equal to the federal rate, you do not complete Form 2106 or 
claim any of your expenses on your return.
However, if your actual expenses are more than the federal rate, you can complete Form 2106 and 
deduct those excess expenses. You must report on Form 2106 your reimbursements up to the federal 
rate (as shown under code L in box 12 of your Form W-2) and all your expenses. You should be able to 
prove these amounts to the IRS.
Example
Joe, a performing artist, lives and works in Austin. In May, his employer sent him 
to San Diego for 4 days and paid the hotel directly for Joe’s hotel bill. The employer 
reimbursed Joe $75 a day for his meals and incidental expenses. The federal rate for 
San Diego is $74 a day.
Joe can prove that his actual non-entertainment-related meal expenses totaled $380. 
His employer’s accountable plan will not pay more than $75 a day for travel to San 
Diego, so Joe does not give his employer the records that prove that he actually spent 
$380. However, he does account for the time, place, and business purpose of the trip. 
This is Joe’s only business trip this year.
Joe was reimbursed $300 ($75 × 4 days), which is $4 more than the federal rate of 
$296 ($74 × 4 days). His employer includes the $4 as income on Joe’s Form W-2 in box 
1. His employer also enters $296 under code L in box 12 of Joe’s Form W-2.
Joe completes Form 2106 to figure his deductible expenses. He enters the total of his 
actual expenses for the year ($380) on Form 2106. He also enters the reimbursements 
that were not included in his income ($296). His total deductible expense, before the 
50% limit, is $84. After he figures the 50% limit on his unreimbursed meals, he will 
include the balance, $42, as an itemized deduction.
RETURNING EXCESS REIMBURSEMENTS
Under an accountable plan, you are required to return any excess reimbursement or other expense 
allowances for your business expenses to the person paying the reimbursement or allowance. Excess 
reimbursement means any amount for which you did not adequately account within a reasonable period 
of time. For example, if you received a travel advance and you did not spend all the money on business-
related expenses or you do not have proof of all your expenses, you have an excess reimbursement.
For more information, see Adequate Accounting, earlier.

 282  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
Travel advance. You receive a travel advance if your employer provides you with an expense allowance 
before you actually have the expense, and the allowance is reasonably expected to be no more than 
your expense. Under an accountable plan, you are required to adequately account to your employer for 
this advance and to return any excess within a reasonable period of time.
If you do not adequately account for or do not return any excess advance within a reasonable period 
of  time,  the  amount  you  do  not  account  for  or  return  will  be  treated  as  having  been  paid  under  a 
nonaccountable plan (discussed later).
Unproven amounts. If you do not prove that you actually traveled on each day for which you received a 
per diem or car allowance (proving the elements described in Table 20-2), you must return this unproven 
amount of the travel advance within a reasonable period of time. If you do not do this, the unproven 
amount will be considered paid under a nonaccountable plan (discussed later).
Per  diem  allowance  more  than  federal  rate.  If  your  employer’s  accountable  plan  pays  you  an 
allowance that is higher than the federal rate, you do not have to return the difference between the two 
rates for the period you can prove business-related travel expenses. However, the difference will be 
reported as wages on your Form W-2. This excess amount is considered paid under a nonaccountable 
plan (discussed later).
Example
Your employer sends you on a 5-day business trip to Phoenix in March 2024 and gives 
you a $425 ($85 × 5 days) advance to cover your meals and incidental expenses. The 
federal per diem for meals and incidental expenses for Phoenix is $74. Your trip lasts 
only 3 days. Under your employer’s accountable plan, you must return the $170 ($85 
× 2 days) advance for the 2 days you did not travel. For the 3 days you did travel, you 
do not have to return the $33 difference between the allowance you received and the 
federal rate for Phoenix (($85 − $74) × 3 days). However, the $33 will be reported on 
your Form W-2 as wages.
Nonaccountable Plans
A nonaccountable plan is a reimbursement or expense allowance arrangement that does not meet one 
or more of the three rules listed earlier under Accountable Plans.
In addition, even if your employer has an accountable plan, the following payments will be treated as 
being paid under a nonaccountable plan.
• Excess reimbursements you fail to return to your employer.
• Reimbursement  of  nondeductible  expenses  related  to  your  employer’s  business.  See 
Reimbursement of nondeductible expenses under Accountable Plans, earlier.

 283  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
If  you  are  not  sure  if  the  reimbursement  or  expense  allowance  arrangement  is  an  accountable  or 
nonaccountable plan, ask your employer.
Reporting  your  expenses  under  a  nonaccountable  plan.  Your employer will combine the amount 
of any reimbursement or other expense allowance paid to you under a nonaccountable plan with your 
wages, salary, or other pay. Your employer will report the total in box 1 of your Form W-2.
You must be an Armed Forces reservist, fee-based state or local government official, qualified performing 
artist, or disabled employee with impairment-related work expenses and complete Form 2106 to deduct 
your expenses for travel, transportation, or meals. Your non-entertainment-related meal expenses will be 
subject to the 50% limit discussed earlier under Meals and Entertainment Expenses. 
Example
Kim’s employer gives her $1,000 a month ($12,000 for the year) for her business 
expenses. Kim does not have to provide any proof of her expenses to her employer, and 
Kim can keep any funds that she does not spend.
Kim,  a  performing  artist,  is  being  reimbursed  under  a  nonaccountable  plan.  Her 
employer will include the $12,000 on Kim’s Form W-2 as if it were wages. If Kim 
wants to deduct her business expenses, she must complete Form 2106 and itemize her 
deductions.
COMPLETING FORM 2106
This  section  briefly  describes  how  employees  complete  Form  2106.  Table  20-3  explains  what  the 
employer reports on Form W-2 and what the employee reports on Form 2106. The instructions for the 
forms have more information on completing them.
Caution!
 
If you are self-employed, do not file Form 2106. Report your expenses on Schedule C 
(Form 1040) or F (Form 1040). See the instructions for the form that you must file.

work.
Employee  business  expenses  other  than  non-entertainment-related  meals.  Show  your  other  
employee business expenses on Form 2106, lines 3 and 4, column A. Do not include expenses for non-
entertainment-related meals on those lines. Line 4 is for expenses such as gifts, educational expenses 
(tuition and books), office-in-the-home expenses, and trade and professional publications.
Non-entertainment-related  meal  expenses.  Show  the  full  amount  of  your  expenses  for  non-
entertainment-related meals on Form 2106, line 5, column B. Include meals while away from your tax 
home overnight and other business meals. See the Meals  Deduction  From  Restaurants  Worksheet  in  
the 2023 Instructions to Form 2106 for reporting information.
“Hours of service” limits. If you are subject to the Department of Transportation’s “hours of service” 
limits, use 80% instead of 50% for meals while away from your tax home.
Reimbursements. Enter on Form 2106, line 7, the amounts your employer (or third party) reimbursed 
you that were not included in box 1 of your Form W-2. This includes any reimbursement reported under 
code L in box 12 of Form W-2.
Allocating  your  reimbursement.  If  you  were  reimbursed  under  an  accountable  plan  and  want  to 
deduct excess expenses that were not reimbursed, you may have to allocate your reimbursement. This 
is necessary if your employer pays your reimbursement in the following manner.
• Pays you a single amount that covers non-entertainment-related meals, as well as other 
business expenses.
• Does not clearly identify how much is for deductible non-entertainment-related meals.
You must allocate that single payment so that you know how much to enter on Form 2106, line 7, column 
A and column B.
Example
Rob’s  employer  paid  him  an  expense  allowance  of  $12,000  this  year  under  an 
accountable plan. The $12,000 payment consisted of $5,000 for airfare and $7,000 
for non-entertainment-related meals and car expenses. Rob’s employer did not clearly 
show how much of the $7,000 was for the cost of deductible non-entertainment related 
meals. Rob actually spent $14,000 during the year ($5,500 for airfare, $4,500 for non-
entertainment-related meals, and $4,000 for car expenses).
Since the airfare allowance was clearly identified, Rob knows that $5,000 of the payment 
goes in column A, line 7 of Form 2106. To allocate the remaining $7,000, Rob uses the 
worksheet from the instructions for Form 2106. His completed worksheet follows.

of the limits described next.
These limits are figured in the following order on the specified form.
1. Limit on meals. Certain non-entertainment-related meal expenses are subject to a 50% 
limit. Entertainment expenses paid or incurred after 2017 are not deductible. If you are an 
employee, you figure the 50% limit on line 9 of Form 2106. See 50% Limit on Meals under 
Meals and Entertainment Expenses, earlier.
2. Limit on total itemized deductions. Limitations on itemized deductions are suspended 
for tax years beginning after 2017, and before tax year January 2026.
SPECIAL RULES
This section discusses special rules that apply to Armed Forces reservists, government officials who are 
paid on a fee basis, performing artists, and disabled employees with impairment-related work expenses. 
For tax years beginning after 2017, they are the only taxpayers that can use Form 2106.

 287  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
Armed Forces reservists traveling more than 100 miles from home. If you are a member of a reserve 
component of the Armed Forces of the United States and you travel more than 100 miles away from 
home in connection with your performance of services as a member of the reserves, you can deduct 
your  travel  expenses  as  an  adjustment  to  gross  income.  The  amount  of  expenses  you  can  deduct  as  
an adjustment to gross income is limited to the regular federal per diem rate (for lodging, meals, and 
incidental expenses) and the standard mileage rate (for car expenses) plus any parking fees, ferry fees, 
and  tolls.  The  federal  rate  is  explained  earlier  under  Per  Diem  and  Car  Allowances.  Any  expenses  in  
excess of these amounts can’t be deducted.
Member of a reserve component. You are a member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces of 
the United States if you are in the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, or Coast Guard Reserve, the 
Army National Guard of the United States, the Air National Guard of the United States, or the Reserve 
Corps of the Public Health Service.
How to report. If you have reserve-related travel that takes you more than 100 miles from home, you 
should first complete Form 2106. Then include your expenses for reserve travel over 100 miles from 
home, up to the federal rate, from Form 2106, line 10, in the total on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 12.
You cannot deduct expenses of travel that does not take you more than 100 miles from home as an 
adjustment to gross income.
Officials paid on a fee basis. Certain fee-basis officials can claim their employee business expenses 
on Form 2106.
Fee-basis officials are persons who are employed by a state or local government and who are paid in 
whole or in part on a fee basis. They can deduct their business expenses in performing services in that 
job as an adjustment to gross income.
If you are a fee-basis official, include your employee business expenses from Form 2106, line 10, on 
Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 12.
Expenses of certain performing artists. If you are a performing artist, you may qualify to deduct your 
employee business expenses as an adjustment to gross income. To qualify, you must meet all of the 
following requirements.
1. During the tax year, you perform services in the performing arts as an employee for at 
least two employers.
2. You receive at least $200 each from any two of these employers.
3. Your related performing-arts business expenses are more than 10% of your gross income 
from the performance of those services.
4. Your adjusted gross income is not more than $16,000 before deducting these business 
expenses.
Special rules for married persons. If you are married, you must file a joint return unless you lived apart 
from your spouse at all times during the tax year.

 288  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
If you file a joint return, you must figure requirements (1), (2), and (3) separately for both you and your 
spouse. However, requirement (4) applies to your and your spouse’s combined adjusted gross income.
Where to report. If you meet all of the above requirements, you should first complete Form 2106. Then 
you include your performing-arts-related expenses from line 10 of Form 2106 in the total on Schedule 1 
(Form 1040), line 12.
If you do not meet all of the above requirements, you do not qualify to deduct your expenses as an 
adjustment to gross income.
Impairment-related work expenses of disabled employees. If you are an employee with a physical 
or mental disability, you can deduct your impairment-related work expenses. After you complete Form 
2106, enter your impairment-related work expenses from Form 2106, line 10, on Schedule A (Form 
1040), line 16, and identify the type and amount of this expense on the line next to line 16. You cannot 
deduct your employee business expenses.
Impairment-related work expenses are your allowable expenses for attendant care at your workplace 
and other expenses you have in connection with your workplace that are necessary for you to be able to 
work. For more information, see Chapter 22.

CHAPTER 20: SOLUTIONS AND SUGGESTED RESPONSES
Below are the solutions and suggested responses for the questions on the previous page(s). If you 
choose an incorrect answer, you should review the pages as indicated for each question to ensure 
comprehension of the material.
1.A. Incorrect. A work assignment can last for more time than this period without affecting 
the taxpayer’s tax home. 
B. CORRECT. An assignment is considered temporary if it is expected to last 12 months 
or less. You must determine whether your assignment is temporary or indefinite when 
you start work. If your assignment is temporary, your tax home does not change.
C. Incorrect. A work assignment that is realistically expected to last more than 12 months 
at a single location is considered indefinite. In such a case, your tax home becomes the 
same as your new location.
D. Incorrect. This time period is too long.
(See page 251 of the course material.)
2.A. Incorrect. You can actually claim more than $51 a day; you can claim a $69 a day meal 
allowance.
B. Incorrect.  If  you  meet  the  requirements  to  be  considered  an  employee  in  the  
transportation industry, you can claim more than $55 a day standard meal allowance for 
travel inside the continental U.S.
C. CORRECT.  If  you  meet  the  requirements  to  be  considered  an  employee  in  the 
transportation industry, you can claim $69 a day standard meal allowance for travel 
within the continental U.S.
D. Incorrect.  The  standard  meal  allowance  for  travel  outside  of  the  continental  U.S.  is  
limited to $74 per day.
(See page 257 of the course material.)
3.A. CORRECT. The 50% limit applies to certain employees or their employers, and to self-
employed persons or their clients, depending on whether the expenses are reimbursed.
B. Incorrect. The limit of deductibility of business-related meal expenses is not 60%.
C. Incorrect. The deductibility limit for business-related meal expenses is not 75%.
D. Incorrect. The correct percentage is less than 100%.
(See page 262 of the course material.)

 292  •  Chapter 20: Other Adjustments to Income
4.A. Incorrect. Gifts are limited as to deductibility.
B. CORRECT. Therefore, a gift to the company cannot be deductible if a gift has already 
been given to the person at or above the deductible limit.
C. Incorrect. Spouses are treated as one taxpayer.
D. Incorrect. Partnerships and partners are treated as one taxpayer.
(See page 265 of the course material.)
5.A. Incorrect. You should generally keep records and receipts that support your deduction 
for longer than one year from the date you file the income tax return.
B. Incorrect. You should generally keep records and receipts that support your deduction 
for longer than two years from the date you made the purchase/expense.
C. CORRECT.  You  must  keep  records  for  as  long  as  they  may  be  needed  for  the 
administration of any provision of the Internal Revenue Code. Generally, you must keep 
your records that support your deduction (or any item of income) for three years from 
the date you file the income tax return on which the deduction was claimed.
D. Incorrect. You must keep records for as long as they may be needed for the administration 
of any provision of the Internal Revenue Code. This is typically for three years from the 
date you file the income tax return on which the deduction was claimed, not four years 
after the purchase/expense was made.
(See page 277 of the course material.)

 293  •  Part Five: Standard Deduction and Other Deductions
PART FIVE: STANDARD DEDUCTION AND  
OTHER DEDUCTIONS
After you have figured your adjusted gross income, you are ready to subtract the deductions used to 
figure taxable income. You can subtract either the standard  deduction  or  itemized deductions, and, if 
you qualify, the qualified business income deduction. Itemized deductions are deductions for certain 
expenses that are listed on Schedule A (Form 1040). The eight chapters in this part discuss the standard 
deduction  and  each  itemized  deduction.  See  Chapter  21  for  the  factors  to  consider  when  deciding  
whether to subtract the standard deduction or itemized deductions. See Chapter 28 for information on 
the new qualified business income deduction.

 294  •  Chapter 21: Standard Deduction
CHAPTER 21: STANDARD DEDUCTION
Chapter Objective
After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• Recall the standard deduction amounts for the current year.
I.   IMPORTANT CHANGES 
Increase  in  standard  deduction.  The standard  deduction  for  some  taxpayers  who  do  not  itemize  
deductions on Schedule A of Form 1040 has been increased for all filers. The amount depends on your 
filing status. The 2024 standard deduction is increased to:
• Single or married separate – $14,600
• Married joint or qualifying surviving spouse – $29,200
• Head of household – $21,900
Changes to itemized deductions. For the years 2018 through 2025, your itemized deductions are no 
longer limited if your AGI is over a certain limit. However, your deduction for state and local income, 
sales, real estate, and property taxes is limited to a combined total deduction of $10,000 ($5,000 if 
married filing separately). Also, you can no longer deduct job-related expenses or other miscellaneous 
itemized deductions that were subject to the 2%-of-adjusted-gross-income floor. These changes will 
impact your choice of whether to take a standard deduction or to itemize deductions. There may be other 
changes that impact the amount of your itemized deductions.
II. INTRODUCTION 
This chapter discusses: 
• How to figure the amount of your standard deduction, 
• The standard deduction for dependents, and
• Who should itemize deductions. 
Most taxpayers have a choice of either taking a standard deduction or itemizing their deductions. If you 
have a choice, you can use the method that gives you the lower tax. The standard deduction is a dollar 
amount that reduces your taxable income. It is a benefit that eliminates the need for many taxpayers to 
itemize actual deductions, such as medical expenses, charitable contributions, and taxes, on Schedule 
A (Form 1040). The standard deduction is higher for taxpayers who:

 295  •  Chapter 21: Standard Deduction
• Are 65 or older, or
• Are blind.
Note
The  additional  standard  deduction  for  age  and/or  blindness  is  $1,550  for  married 
individuals, and $1,950 for singles and heads of household. If a taxpayer is both 65 or 
older and blind, he or she is eligible to double the additional amount.
Tip
 
You benefit from the standard deduction if your standard deduction is more than the 
total of your allowable itemized deductions.
Persons  not  eligible  for  the  standard  deduction.  Your  standard  deduction  is  zero  and  you  should  
itemize any deductions you have if:
• Your filing status is married filing separately, and your spouse itemizes deductions on his 
or her return;
• You  are  filing  a  tax  return  for  a  short  tax  year  because  of  a  change  in  your  annual 
accounting period; or
• You  are  a  nonresident  or  dual-status  alien  during  the  year.  You  are  considered  a  dual-
status alien if you were both a nonresident and resident alien during the year.
If you are a nonresident alien who is married to a U.S. citizen or resident alien at the end of the year, 
you can choose to be treated as a U.S. resident. If you make this choice, you can take the standard 
deduction.
Caution!
 
If you can be claimed as a dependent on another person’s return (such as your parents’ 
return), your standard deduction may be limited.

 296  •  Chapter 21: Standard Deduction
III. STANDARD DEDUCTION AMOUNT 
The standard deduction amount depends on your filing status, whether you are 65 or older or blind, and 
whether another taxpayer can claim you as a dependent. Generally, the standard  deduction  amounts  
are adjusted each year for inflation. 
Decedent’s final return. The amount of the standard deduction for a decedent’s final return is the same 
as it would have been had the decedent continued to live. However, if the decedent was not 65 or older 
at the time of death, the higher standard deduction for age cannot be claimed. 
HIGHER STANDARD DEDUCTION FOR AGE (65 OR OLDER) 
If you are age 65 or older on the last day of the year and do not itemize deductions, you are entitled to a 
higher standard deduction. You are considered 65 on the day before your 65th birthday. Therefore, you 
can take a higher standard deduction for 2024 if you were born before January 2, 1960. 
HIGHER STANDARD DEDUCTION FOR BLINDNESS 
If you are blind on the last day of the year and you do not itemize deductions, you are entitled to a higher 
standard deduction. 
Not  totally  blind.  If you are not totally blind, you must get a certified statement from an eye doctor 
(ophthalmologist or optometrist) that:  
1. You cannot see better than 20/200 in the better eye with glasses or contact lenses, or 
2. Your field of vision is 20 degrees or less.  
If your eye condition is not likely to improve beyond these limits, the statement should include this fact. 
Keep the statement in your records. 
If your vision can be corrected beyond these limits only by contact lenses that you can wear only briefly 
because of pain, infection, or ulcers, you can take the higher standard deduction for blindness if you 
otherwise qualify. 
SPOUSE 65 OR OLDER OR BLIND 
You can take the higher standard deduction if your spouse is age 65 or older or blind and:  
1. You file a joint return, or 
2. You file a separate return and can claim an exemption for your spouse because your 
spouse had no gross income and cannot be claimed as a dependent by another taxpayer.  

 297  •  Chapter 21: Standard Deduction
Caution!
 
You cannot claim the higher standard deduction for an individual other than yourself 
and your spouse.
I V.  STANDARD DEDUCTION FOR DEPENDENTS
The standard deduction for an individual who can be claimed as a dependent on another person’s tax 
return is generally limited to the greater of:
• $1,300, or
• The individual’s earned income for the year plus $450 (but not more than the regular 
standard deduction amount, generally $14,600).
However, if the individual is 65 or older or blind, the standard deduction may be higher.

CHAPTER 22: MEDICAL AND DENTAL EXPENSES
Chapter Objective
After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• Recognize the deductibility characteristics of medical and dental expenses.
I.   IMPORTANT 
Medical expense floor. In 2024, you can deduct only the part of your medical and dental expenses that 
exceed 7.5% of adjusted gross income (AGI). 
Standard mileage rate. The standard mileage rate allowed for operating expenses for a car when you 
use it for medical reasons is 21.0 cents per mile for 2024. 
II. INTRODUCTION 
This chapter will help you determine: 
• What medical expenses are,
• What expenses you can include this year, 
• How much of the expenses you can deduct, 
• Whose medical expenses you can include, 
• What medical expenses are includible, 
• How to treat reimbursements, 
• How to report the deduction on your tax return,
• How to report impairment-related work expenses, and
• How to report health insurance costs if you are self-employed.
III. WHAT ARE MEDICAL EXPENSES? 
Medical expenses are the costs of diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and 
the cost for treatments affecting any part or function of the body. These expenses include payments for 
legal medical services rendered by physicians, surgeons, dentists, and other medical practitioners. They 
include the costs of equipment, supplies, and diagnostic devices needed for these purposes.

 301  •  Chapter 22: Medical and Dental Expenses
I V.  WHAT EXPENSES CAN BE INCLUDED THIS YEAR? 
You can include only the medical and dental expenses you paid this year, but generally not payments for 
medical or dental care you will receive in a future year. If you pay medical expenses by check, the day 
you mail or deliver the check generally is the date of payment. If you use a “pay-by-phone” or “online” 
account  to  pay  your  medical expenses, the date reported on the statement of the financial institution 
showing when payment was made is the date of payment. You can include medical expenses you charge 
to your credit card in the year the charge is made, not when you actually pay the amount charged. 
V.   HOW MUCH OF THE EXPENSES CAN BE DEDUCTED? 
Generally, you can deduct on Schedule A (Form 1040) only the amount of your medical and dental 
expenses that is more than 7.5% of your adjusted gross income (AGI). 
VI. WHOSE MEDICAL EXPENSES CAN BE INCLUDED? 
You can generally include medical expenses you pay for yourself, as well as those you pay for someone 
who was your spouse or your dependent either when the services were provided or when you paid for 
them. There are different rules for decedents and for individuals who are the subject of multiple support 
agreements. 
Spouse. You can include medical expenses you paid for your spouse. To include these expenses, you 
must have been married either at the time your spouse received the medical services or at the time you 
paid the medical expenses.
Example 1
Mary received medical treatment before she married Bill. Bill paid for the treatment 
after they married. Bill can include these expenses in figuring his medical expense 
deduction even if Bill and Mary file separate returns.
If Mary had paid the expenses before she and Bill married, Bill could not include Mary’s 
expenses in his separate return. Mary would include the amounts she paid during the 
year in her separate return. If they filed a joint return, the medical expenses both paid 
during the year would be used to figure their medical expense deduction. 
 

 302  •  Chapter 22: Medical and Dental Expenses
Example 2
This year, John paid medical expenses for his wife, Louise, who died last year. John 
married Belle this year, and they file a joint return. Because John was married to Louise 
when she received the medical services, he can include those expenses in figuring his 
medical expense deduction for this year.
Dependent. You can include medical expenses you paid for your dependent. To claim these expenses, 
the person must have been your dependent either at the time the medical services were provided or 
at the time you paid the expenses. A person generally qualifies as your dependent for purposes of the 
medical expense deduction if both of the following requirements are met:  
1. The person was a qualifying child or a qualifying relative, and 
2. The person was a U.S. citizen or national, or a resident of the United States, Canada, or 
Mexico.
You  can  include  medical expenses you paid for an individual that would have been your dependent 
except that:
1. He or she received gross income of $5,050 or more in 2024;
2. He or she filed a joint return for 2024; or
3. You, or your spouse if filing jointly, could be claimed as a dependent on someone else’s 
2024 return.  
Support claimed under a multiple support agreement. A multiple support agreement is used when 
two or more people provide more than half of a person’s support, but no one alone provides more than 
half.  If  you  are  considered  to  have  provided  more  than  half  of  a  qualifying  relative’s  support  under  a  
multiple support agreement, you can include medical expenses you pay for that person. 
Any medical expenses paid by others who joined you in the agreement cannot be included as medical 
expenses by anyone. However, you can include the entire unreimbursed amount you paid for medical 
expenses.

 303  •  Chapter 22: Medical and Dental Expenses
Example
You and your three brothers each provide one-fourth of your mother’s total support. 
Under a multiple support agreement, you claim your mother as a dependent. You 
paid all of her medical expenses. Your brothers repaid you for three-fourths of these 
expenses.  In  figuring  your  medical  expense  deduction,  you  can  include  only  one-
fourth of your mother’s medical expenses. Your brothers cannot include any part of the 
expenses. However, if you and your brothers share the nonmedical support items and 
you separately pay all of your mother’s medical expenses, you can include the amount 
you paid for her medical expenses in your medical expenses. 
VII. WHAT MEDICAL EXPENSES ARE INCLUDIBLE? 
Use Table  22-1  in  this  chapter  as  a  guide  to  determine  which  medical  and  dental  expenses  you  can  
include on Schedule A (Form 1040).
This table does not include all possible medical expenses. To determine if an expense not listed can be

 305  •  Chapter 22: Medical and Dental Expenses
INSURANCE PREMIUMS  
You can include in medical expenses insurance premiums you pay for policies that cover medical care. 
Medical care policies can provide payment for treatment that includes: 
• Hospitalization, surgical fees, X-rays, 
• Prescription drugs and insulin,
• Dental care, 
• Replacement of lost or damaged contact lenses, and
• Long-term care (subject to additional limitations). 
If you have a policy that provides payments for other than medical care, you can include the premiums 
for the medical care part of the policy if the charge for the medical part is reasonable. The cost of the 
medical part must be separately stated in the insurance contract or given to you in a separate statement. 
Long-term care services. Contributions made by your employer to provide coverage for qualified long-
term care services under a flexible spending or similar arrangement must be included in your income. 
This amount will be reported as wages on your Form W-2. 
Health reimbursement arrangement (HRA). If you have medical expenses that are reimbursed by a 
health reimbursement arrangement, you cannot include those expenses in your medical expenses. This 
is because an HRA is funded solely by the employer.
Medicare A. If you are covered under social security (or if you are a government employee who paid 
Medicare tax), you are enrolled in Medicare  A.  The  payroll  tax  paid  for  Medicare  A  is  not  a  medical  
expense.  If  you  are  not  covered  under  social  security  (or  were  not  a  government  employee  who  paid  
Medicare tax), you can voluntarily enroll in Medicare A. In this situation the premiums paid for Medicare 
A can be included as a medical expense. 
Medicare B. Medicare B is a supplemental medical insurance. Premiums you pay for Medicare B are a 
medical expense. Check the information you received from the Social Security Administration to find out 
your premium. 
Medicare D. Medicare D is a voluntary prescription drug insurance program for persons with Medicare A 
or B. You can include as a medical expense premiums you pay for Medicare D.
MEALS AND LODGING 
You can include in medical expenses the cost of meals and lodging at a hospital or similar institution if a 
principal reason for being there is to receive medical care. 
TRANSPORTATION 
Include in medical expenses amounts paid for transportation primarily for, and essential to, medical care. 

 306  •  Chapter 22: Medical and Dental Expenses
You can include: 
• Bus, taxi, train, or plane fares, or ambulance service, 
• Transportation expenses of a parent who must go with a child who needs medical care,
• Transportation expenses of a nurse or other person who can give injections, medications, 
or other treatment required by a patient who is traveling to get medical care and is unable 
to travel alone, and 
• Transportation expenses for regular visits to see a mentally ill dependent, if these visits 
are recommended as a part of treatment. 
Car expenses. You can include out-of-pocket expenses for your car, such as gas and oil, when you use 
your car for medical reasons. You cannot include depreciation, insurance, general repair, or maintenance 
expenses. 
If you do not want to use your actual expenses for 2024, you can use the standard medical mileage rate 
of 21.0 cents per mile. 
You can also include the cost of parking fees and tolls. You can add these fees and tolls to your medical 
expenses whether you use actual expenses or use the standard mileage rate.
DISABLED DEPENDENT CARE EXPENSES 
Some disabled dependent care expenses may qualify as either medical expenses or as work-related 
expenses for purposes of taking a credit for dependent care. (See chapter 31.) You can choose to apply 
them either way as long as you do not use the same expenses to claim both a credit and a medical 
expense deduction. 
VIII. HOW TO TREAT REIMBURSEMENTS 
You  can  include  in  medical  expenses only those amounts paid during the taxable year for which you 
received no insurance or other reimbursement. 
INSURANCE REIMBURSEMENT 
You must reduce your total medical expenses for the year by all reimbursements for medical expenses 
that you receive from insurance or other sources during the year. This includes payments from Medicare. 
Even  if  a  policy  provides  reimbursement  for  only  certain  specific  medical  expenses,  you  must  use 
amounts you receive from that policy to reduce your total medical expenses, including those it does not 
reimburse.
Health  reimbursement  arrangement  (HRA). A health reimbursement arrangement is an employer-
funded plan that reimburses employees for medical care expenses and allows unused amounts to be 
carried forward. An HRA is funded solely by the employer and the reimbursements for medical expenses, 
up to a maximum dollar amount for a coverage period, are not included in your income.

 307  •  Chapter 22: Medical and Dental Expenses
Premiums  paid  by  you.  If  you  pay  either  the  entire  premium  for  your  medical  insurance  or  all  of  the  
costs of a plan similar to medical insurance and your insurance payments or other reimbursements are 
more than your total medical expenses for the year, you have an excess reimbursement. You generally 
do not include an excess reimbursement in your gross income. 
Medical  expenses  not  deducted.  If  you  did  not  deduct  a  medical  expense  in  the  year  you  paid  it  
because your medical expenses were not more than 7.5% of your adjusted gross income, or because 
you did not itemize deductions, do not include the reimbursement up to the amount of the expense in 
income.
IX. DAMAGES FOR PERSONAL INJURIES
If you receive an amount in settlement of a personal injury suit, part of that award may be for medical 
expenses that you deducted in an earlier year. If it is, you must include that part in your income in the 
year you receive it to the extent it reduced your taxable income in the earlier year. 
Future medical expenses. If you receive an amount in settlement of a damage suit for personal injuries, 
part of that award may be for future medical expenses. If it is, you must reduce any future medical 
expenses for these injuries until the amount you received has been completely used.
FIGURE 22-A. IS YOUR EXCESS MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENT TAXABLE?
*See Premiums paid by you and your employer in this chapter.

 308  •  Chapter 22: Medical and Dental Expenses
X. HOW TO FIGURE AND REPORT DEDUCTIONS ON A TAX RETURN 
Once you have determined which medical care expenses you can include, you figure and report the 
deduction on your tax return. 
WHAT TAX FORM DO YOU USE? 
You figure your medical expense deduction on Schedule A (Form 1040). If you need more information on 
itemized deductions, or you are not sure if you can itemize, see chapter 21.
XI. IMPAIRMENT-RELATED    WORK    EXPENSES    (BUSINESS    OR    
MEDICA L) 
If you are a person with a disability, you can take a business deduction for expenses that are necessary 
for you to be able to work. If you take a business deduction for these impairment-related work expenses, 
they are not subject to the 7.5% limit that applies to medical expenses.
You have a disability if you have:
• A physical or mental disability (for example, blindness or deafness) that functionally limits 
your being employed, or 
• A  physical  or  mental  impairment  (for  example,  a  sight  or  hearing  impairment)  that 
substantially limits one or more of your major life activities, such as performing manual 
tasks, walking, speaking, breathing, learning, or working. 
Impairment-related expenses defined. Impairment-related expenses are those ordinary and necessary 
business expenses that are: 
• Necessary for you to do your work satisfactorily, 
• For  goods  or  services  not  required  or  used,  other  than  incidentally,  in  your  personal 
activities, and 
• Not specifically covered under other income tax laws. 
XII. HEALTH INSURANCE COSTS FOR SELF-EMPLOYED PERSONS
If you were self-employed and had a net profit for the year, you may be able to deduct, as an adjustment 
to income, amounts paid for medical and qualified long-term care insurance on behalf of yourself, your 
spouse, your dependents, and your children who were under age 27 at the end of 2024.
For this purpose, you were self-employed if you were a general partner (or a limited partner receiving 
guaranteed payments) or you received wages from an S corporation in which you were more than a 2% 
shareholder.

 309  •  Chapter 22: Medical and Dental Expenses
The insurance plan must be established under your trade or business, and the deduction cannot be 
more than your earned income from that trade or business.
You cannot deduct payments for medical insurance for any month in which you were eligible to participate 
in a health plan subsidized by your employer, your spouse’s employer, or an employer of your dependent 
child or your child under age 27 at the end of 2024. You cannot deduct payments for a qualified long-
term care insurance contract for any month in which you were eligible to participate in a long-term care 
insurance plan subsidized by your employer or your spouse’s employer.
If you qualify to take the deduction, use the Self-Employed Health Insurance Deduction Worksheet in 
the Form 1040 or 1040-SR instructions to figure the amount you can deduct. But if any of the following 
applies, do not use the worksheet. 
• You had more than one source of income subject to self-employment tax.
• You file Form 2555, Foreign Earned Income.
• You are using amounts paid for qualified long-term care insurance to figure the deduction.
If you cannot use the worksheet in the instructions for Forms 1040 and 1040-SR, use the worksheet in 
Publication 535, Business Expenses, to figure your deduction.
Use Publication 974 instead of the worksheet in the Form 1040 or 1040-SR instructions if you, your 
spouse, or a dependent enrolled in health insurance through the Health Insurance Marketplace and you 
are claiming the premium tax credit.

 311  •  Chapter 22: Medical and Dental Expenses
CHAPTER 22: SOLUTIONS AND SUGGESTED RESPONSES
Below are the solutions and suggested responses for the questions on the previous page(s). If you 
choose an incorrect answer, you should review the pages as indicated for each question to ensure 
comprehension of the material.
1.A. Incorrect. You are only able to deduct medical  expenses  you  incurred  that  are  more  
than 7.5% of your AGI. 7.5% of $60,000 is greater than $3,000.
B. Incorrect. You are only able to deduct medical expenses that are more than 7.5% of 
your AGI. 7.5% of $60,000 is greater than $3,750. 
C. CORRECT.  If  your AGI  is  $60,000,  the  first  $4,500  of  medical  expenses  are  not 
deductible, which is equal to $60,000 x 7.5%.
D. Incorrect. You are only able to deduct medical expenses that are more than 7.5% of 
your AGI. 7.5% of $60,000 is less than $6,000.
(See page 306 of the course material.)
2.A. Incorrect. Payments made for medical and hospital insurance premiums are deductible 
expenses.
B. Incorrect.  Payments  made  for  long-term  care  contracts  are  deductible  as medical 
expenses in the year that the payment was made.
C. Incorrect. Expenditures for stop-smoking programs are deductible medical expenses.
D. CORRECT. Health club dues are generally not deductible medical expenses because 
they do not meet the test for such expenses. Specifically, medical care expenses must 
be primarily to alleviate or prevent a physical or mental defect or illness.
(See pages 308 to 309 of the course material.)

 312  •  Chapter 23: Taxes
CHAPTER 23: TAXES
Chapter Objective
After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• Recognize what taxes you can deduct if you itemize deductions.
I.   IMPORTANT
Limitation  on  deduction  for  state  and  local  taxes.  The  Tax  Cuts  and  Jobs Act  provides  for  the 
temporary  limitation  of  deductions  for  state  and  local  taxes.  See  Limitation  on  deduction  for  state  and  
local taxes, later.
No deduction for foreign taxes paid for real estate. You can no longer deduct foreign taxes you paid 
on real estate.
II. INTRODUCTION 
This chapter discusses which taxes you can deduct if you itemize deductions on Schedule A (Form 
1040). It also explains which taxes you can deduct on other schedules or forms and which taxes you 
cannot deduct.
This chapter covers: 
• Income taxes (federal, state, local, and foreign),
• General sales taxes (state and local), 
• Real estate taxes (state, local, and foreign),
• Personal property taxes (state and local), and 
• Taxes and fees you cannot deduct. 
Use Table 23-1 as a guide to determine which taxes you can deduct.
At the end of the chapter is a section that explains which form you use to deduct the different types of 
taxes. 
Business taxes. You can deduct certain taxes only if they are ordinary and necessary expenses of your 
trade or business or of producing income. 
State  or  local  taxes. These are taxes imposed by the 50 states, U.S. possessions, or any of their 
political subdivisions (such as a county or city), or by the District of Columbia. 

 313  •  Chapter 23: Taxes
Indian  tribal  government.  An  Indian  tribal  government  that  is  recognized  by  the  Secretary  of  the 
Treasury  as  performing  substantial  government  functions  will  be  treated  as  a  state  for  purposes  of 
claiming a deduction for taxes. Income taxes, real estate taxes, and personal property taxes imposed by 
that Indian tribal government (or by any of its subdivisions that are treated as political subdivisions of a 
state) are deductible.
General sales taxes. These are taxes imposed at one rate on retail sales of a broad range of classes of 
items. 
Foreign taxes. These are taxes imposed by a foreign country or any of its political subdivisions. 
III. TESTS TO DEDUCT ANY TAX 
The following two tests must be met for any tax to be deductible by you.  
1. The tax must be imposed on you. 
2. The tax must be paid during your tax year.  
The tax must be imposed on you. Generally, you can deduct only taxes that are imposed on you. 
Generally, you can deduct property taxes only if you are the owner of the property. If your spouse owns 
property and pays real estate taxes on it, the taxes are deductible on your spouse’s separate return or 
on your joint return. 
The  tax  must  be  paid  during  your  tax  year. If you are a cash basis taxpayer, you can deduct only 
those taxes actually paid during your tax year. If you pay your taxes by check, the day you mail or deliver 
the check is generally the date of payment. If you use a pay-by-phone account (such as a credit card or 
electronic funds withdrawal), the date reported on the statement of the financial institution showing when 
payment was made is the date of payment. If you contest a tax liability and are a cash basis taxpayer, 
you can deduct the tax only in the year you actually pay it (or transfer money or other property to provide 
for satisfaction of the contested liability).

I V.  INCOME TAXES 
This section discusses the deductibility of state and local income taxes (including employee contributions 
to state benefit funds) and foreign income taxes. 
STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAXES 
You can deduct state and local income taxes. 

 315  •  Chapter 23: Taxes
Exception
You cannot deduct state and local income taxes you pay on income that is exempt from 
federal income tax, unless the exempt income is interest income. For example, you 
cannot deduct the part of a state’s income tax that is on a cost-of-living allowance that 
is exempt from federal income tax.
What to Deduct 
Your deduction may be for withheld taxes, estimated tax payments, or other tax payments as follows. 
Withheld taxes. You can deduct state and local income taxes withheld from your salary in the year they 
are withheld. Your Form(s) W-2 will show these amounts. Forms W-2G, 1099-B, 1099-DIV, 1099-G, 
1099-K, 1099-MISC, 1099-NEC, 1099-OID, and 1099-R may also show state and local income taxes 
withheld. 
Estimated  tax  payments.  You  can  deduct  estimated  tax  payments  you  made  during  the  year  under  
a pay-as-you-go plan of a state or local government. However, you must have a reasonable basis for 
making the estimated  tax  payments.  Any  estimated  state  or  local  tax  payments  that  are  not  made  in  
good faith at the time of payment are not deductible. 
Example
You  made  an  estimated state  income  tax  payment.  However,  the  estimate  of  your 
state tax liability shows that you will get a refund of the full amount of your estimated 
payment. You had no reasonable basis to believe you had any additional liability for 
state income taxes and you cannot deduct the estimated tax payment. 
Refund applied to taxes. You can deduct any part of a refund of prior-year state or local income taxes 
that you chose to have credited to your 2024 estimated state or local income taxes. 
Do not reduce your deduction by either of the following items. 
• Any state or local income tax refund (or credit) you expect to receive for 2024. 
• Any refund of (or credit for) prior-year state and local income taxes you actually received 
in 2024. 
However, part or all of this refund (or credit) may be taxable. 
Separate  federal  returns. If you and your spouse file separate state, local, and federal  income  tax  
returns, you each can deduct on your federal return only the amount of your own state and local income 
tax that you paid during the tax year. 
Joint  state  and  local  returns. If you and your spouse file joint state and local returns and separate 
federal returns, each of you can deduct on your separate federal return part of the state and local income 

 316  •  Chapter 23: Taxes
taxes paid during the tax year. You can deduct only the amount of the total taxes that is proportionate 
to your gross income compared to the combined gross income of you and your spouse. However, you 
cannot deduct more than the amount you actually paid during the year. You can avoid this calculation if 
you and your spouse are jointly and individually liable for the full amount of the state and local income 
taxes. If so, you and your spouse can deduct on your separate federal returns the amount you each 
actually paid. 
Joint  federal  return. If you file a joint federal return, you can deduct the total of the state and local 
income taxes both of you paid.
Contributions to state benefit funds. As an employee, you can deduct mandatory contributions to 
state benefit funds withheld from your wages that provide protection against loss of wages. Mandatory 
payments made to the following state benefit funds are deductible as state income taxes on Schedule A 
(Form 1040), line 5a.
• Alaska Unemployment Compensation Fund.
• California Nonoccupational Disability Benefit Fund.
• New Jersey Nonoccupational Disability Benefit Fund.
• New Jersey Unemployment Compensation Fund.
• New York Nonoccupational Disability Benefit Fund.
• Pennsylvania Unemployment Compensation Fund.
• Rhode Island Temporary Disability Benefit Fund.
• Washington State Supplemental Workmen’s Compensation Fund.
FOREIGN INCOME TAXES 
Generally, you take either a deduction or a credit for income taxes imposed on you by a foreign country 
or a U.S. possession. However, you cannot take a deduction or credit for foreign income taxes paid on 
income that is exempt from U.S. tax under the foreign earned income exclusion or the foreign housing 
exclusion. 
V.   STATE AND LOCAL GENERAL SALES TAXES 
You can elect to deduct state and local general sales taxes instead of state and local income taxes, as 
an itemized deduction on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 5a. You can use either your actual expenses or 
the state and local sales tax tables to figure your sales tax deduction.
Actual expenses. Generally, you can deduct the actual state and local general sales taxes (including 
compensating use taxes) if the tax rate was the same as the general sales tax rate. However, sales 
taxes on food, clothing, medical supplies, and motor vehicles are deductible as a general sales tax even 
if the tax rate was less than the general sales tax rate. If you paid sales tax on a motor vehicle at a rate 

 317  •  Chapter 23: Taxes
higher than the general sales tax rate, you can deduct only the amount of tax that you would have paid 
at the general sales tax rate on that vehicle. If you use the actual expenses method, you must have 
receipts to show the general sales taxes paid. Do not include sales taxes paid on items in your trade or 
business on Schedule A (Form 1040).
Optional sales tax tables. Instead of using your actual expenses, you can figure your state and local 
general sales tax deduction using the state and local sales tax tables in the Instructions for Schedule 
A (Form 1040). You may also be able to add the state and local general sales taxes paid on certain 
specified items.
Your applicable table amount is based on the state where you live, your income, and the number of 
dependents claimed on your tax return. Your income is your adjusted gross income plus any nontaxable 
items such as the following.
• Tax-exempt interest.
• Veterans’ benefits.
• Nontaxable combat pay.
• Workers’ compensation.
• Nontaxable part of social security and railroad retirement benefits.
• Nontaxable part of IRA, pension, or annuity distributions, excluding rollovers.
• Public assistance payments.
If you lived in different states during the same tax year, you must prorate your applicable table amount 
for each state based on the days you lived in each state. See the Instructions for Schedule A (Form 
1040), line 5a, for details.
VI. STATE AND LOCAL REAL ESTATE TAXES  
Deductible real estate taxes are any state and local taxes on real property levied for the general public 
welfare.  You  can  deduct  these  taxes  only  if  they  are  assessed  uniformly  against  all  property  under  
the jurisdiction of the taxing authority. The proceeds must be for general community or governmental 
purposes and not be payment for a special privilege granted or service rendered to you.
Deductible real estate taxes generally do not include taxes charged for local benefits and improvements 
that  increase  the  value  of  the  property.  They  also  do  not  include  itemized  charges  for  services  (such  
as trash collection) against specific property or certain people, even if the charge is paid to the taxing 
authority. For more information about taxes and charges that are not deductible, see Real Estate-Related 
Items You Cannot Deduct, later. 
Tenant-shareholders in a cooperative housing corporation. Generally, if you are a tenant-stockholder 
in a cooperative housing corporation, you can deduct the amount paid to the corporation that represents 

 318  •  Chapter 23: Taxes
your share of the real estate taxes the corporation paid or incurred for your dwelling unit. The corporation 
should provide you with a statement showing your share of the taxes.
Division of real estate taxes between buyers and sellers. If you bought or sold real estate during the 
year, the real estate taxes must be divided between the buyer and the seller. 
The buyer and the seller must divide the real estate taxes according to the number of days in the real 
property tax year (the period to which the tax imposed relates) that each owned the property. The seller 
is treated as paying the taxes up to, but not including, the date of sale. The buyer is treated as paying the 
taxes beginning with the date of sale. This applies regardless of the lien dates under local law. Generally, 
this information is included on the settlement statement provided at the closing. 
If you (the seller) cannot deduct taxes until they are paid because you use the cash method of accounting, 
and the buyer of your property is personally liable for the tax, you are considered to have paid your part 
of the tax at the time of the sale. This lets you deduct the part of the tax to the date of sale even though 
you did not actually pay it. However, you must also include the amount of that tax in the selling price of 
the property. The buyer must include the same amount in his or her cost of the property. 
WORKSHEET   23-1.   FIGURING   YOUR   STATE   AND   LOCAL   REAL   ESTATE   TAX   
DEDUCTION
You figure your deduction for taxes on each property bought or sold during the real property tax year as 
follows:
1. Enter  the  total  state  and  local  real  estate  taxes  for  the  real  
property tax year
 
_________
2. Enter the number of days in the real property tax year that 
you owned the property...
 
_________
3. Divide line 2 by 365 (for leap years, divide line 2 by 366) _________
4. Multiple line 1 by line 3. This is your deduction. Enter it on 
Schedule A (Form 1040), line 5b
 
_________
Repeat steps 1 through 4 for each property you bought or sold during the real property tax year. Your total deduction is the sum 
of the line 4 amounts for all of the properties.
Real estate taxes for prior years. Do not divide delinquent taxes between the buyer and seller if the 
taxes are for any real property tax year before the one in which the property is sold. Even if the buyer 
agrees to pay the delinquent taxes, the buyer cannot deduct them. The buyer must add them to the cost 
of the property. The seller can deduct these taxes paid by the buyer. However, the seller must include 
them in the selling price. 
Examples. The following examples illustrate how real estate taxes are divided between buyer and seller. 

 319  •  Chapter 23: Taxes
Example 1
Dennis and Beth White’s real property tax year for both their old home and their new 
home is the calendar year, with payment due August 1. The tax on their old home, sold 
on May 7, was $620. The tax on their new home, bought on May 3, was $732. Dennis 
and Beth are considered to have paid a proportionate share of the real estate taxes on 
the old home even though they did not actually pay them to the taxing authority. On 
the other hand, they can claim only a proportionate share of the taxes they paid on their 
new property even though they paid the entire amount.
Dennis and Beth owned their old home during the real property tax year for 126 days 
(January 1 to May 6, the day before the sale). They figure their deduction for taxes on 
their old home as follows.
Taxes on Old Home
1. Enter the total state and local real estate taxes for 
the real property tax year
 
$620
2. Enter the number of days in the real property tax 
year that you owned the property
 
126
3. Divide line 2 by 365 (for leap years, divide line 2 
by 366) 
 
.3452
4. Multiple line 1 by line 3. This is your deduction. 
Enter it on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 5b
 
$214
Since the buyers of their old home paid all of the taxes, Dennis and Beth also include 
the $214 in the selling price of the old home. (The buyers add the $214 to their cost of 
the home.)
Dennis and Beth owned their new home during the real property tax year for 243 days 
(May 3 to December 31, including their date of purchase). They figure their deduction 
for taxes on their new home as follows:

 320  •  Chapter 23: Taxes
Example 1 (continued)
Taxes on New Home
1. Enter the total state and local real estate taxes 
for the real property tax year
 
$732
2. Enter the number of days in the real property 
tax year that you owned the property
 
243
3. Divide line 2 by 365 (for leap years, divide line 2 
by 366) 
 
.6658
4. Multiple line 1 by line 3. This is your deduction. 
Enter it on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 5b
 
$487
Since Dennis and Beth paid all of the taxes on the new home, they add $245 ($732 paid 
less $487 deduction) to their cost of the new home. (The sellers add this $245 to their 
selling price and deduct the $245 as a real estate tax.)
Dennis and Beth’s real estate tax deduction for their old and new homes is the sum of 
$214 and $487, or $701. They will enter this amount on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 
5b.
Example 2
George and Helen Brown bought a new home on May 3, 2024. Their real property tax 
year for the new home is the calendar year. Real estate taxes for 2023 were assessed in 
their state on January 1, 2024. The taxes became due on May 31, 2024 and October 31, 
2024.
The Browns agreed to pay all taxes due after the date of purchase. Real estate taxes for 
2023 were $680. They paid $340 on May 31, 2024, and $340 on October 31, 2024. 
These taxes were for the 2023 real property tax year. The Browns cannot deduct them 
since they did not own the property until 2024. Instead, they must add $680 to the cost 
of their new home.
In January 2025, the Browns receive their 2024 property tax statement for $752, which 
they will pay in 2025. The Browns owned their new home during the 2024 real property 
tax year for 243 days (May 3 to December 31). They will figure their 2025 deduction for 
taxes as follows. 

 321  •  Chapter 23: Taxes
Example 2 (continued)
1. Enter the total state and local real estate taxes for 
the real property tax year
 
$752
2. Enter the number of days in the real property tax 
year that you owned the property
 
243
3. Divide line 2 by 365 (for leap years, divide line 2 
by 366)
 
.6658
4. Multiple line 1 by line 3. This is your deduction. 
Enter it on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 5b
 
$501
The remaining $251 ($752 paid less $501 deduction) of taxes paid in 2025, along with 
the $680 paid in 2024, is added to the cost of their new home.
Because the taxes up to the date of sale are considered paid by the seller on the date of 
sale, the seller is entitled to a 2024 tax deduction of $931. This is the sum of the $680 
for 2023 and the $251 for the 122 days the seller owned the home in 2024. The seller 
must also include the $931 in the selling price when he or she figures the gain or loss on 
the sale. The seller should contact the Browns in January 2025 to find out how much 
real estate tax is due for 2024.
Form 1099-S. For certain sales or exchanges of real estate, the person responsible for closing the sale 
(generally the settlement agent) prepares Form 1099-S, Proceeds  From  Real  Estate  Transactions, to 
report certain information to the IRS and to the seller of the property. Box 2 of Form 1099-S is for the 
gross proceeds of the sale and should include the portion of the seller’s real estate tax liability that the 
buyer will pay after the date of sale. The buyer includes these taxes in the cost basis of the property, and 
the seller both deducts this amount as a tax paid and includes it in the sales price of the property. 
For a real estate transaction that involves a home, any real estate tax the seller paid in advance but that 
is the liability of the buyer appears in box 6 of Form 1099-S. The buyer deducts this amount as a real 
estate tax, and the seller reduces his or her real estate tax deduction (or includes it in income) by the 
same amount. See Refund (or rebate), later. 
Taxes placed in escrow. If your monthly mortgage payment includes an amount placed in escrow (put 
in the care of a third party) for real estate taxes, you may not be able to deduct the total amount placed in 
escrow. You can deduct only the real estate tax that the third party actually paid to the taxing authority. If 
the third party does not notify you of the amount of real estate tax that was paid for you, contact the third 
party or the taxing authority to find the proper amount to show on your return. 
Tenants by the entirety. If you and your spouse held property as tenants by the entirety and you file 
separate returns, each of you can deduct only the taxes each of you paid on the property. 

 322  •  Chapter 23: Taxes
Divorced individuals. If your divorce or separation agreement states that you must pay the real estate 
taxes for a home owned by you and your spouse, part of your payments may be deductible as alimony 
and part as real estate taxes. See Taxes and insurance, in chapter 18, for more information. 
Minister’s  and  military  personnel  housing  allowances.  If you are a minister or a member of the 
uniformed services and receive a housing allowance that you can exclude from income, you still can 
deduct all of the real estate taxes you pay on your home. 
Refund (or rebate). If you received a refund or rebate in 2024 of real estate taxes you paid in 2024, you 
must reduce your deduction by the amount refunded to you. If you received a refund or rebate in 2024 
of real estate taxes you deducted in an earlier year, you generally must include the refund or rebate in 
income in the year you receive it. However, you only need to include the amount of the deduction that 
reduced your tax in the earlier year. For more information, see Recoveries in chapter 12. 
REAL ESTATE-RELATED ITEMS YOU CANNOT DEDUCT 
Payments for the following items generally are not deductible as real estate taxes. 
• Taxes for local benefits. 
• Itemized charges for services (such as trash and garbage pickup fees). 
• Transfer taxes (or stamp taxes). 
• Rent increases due to higher real estate taxes. 
• Homeowners’ association charges. 
Taxes for local benefits. Deductible real estate taxes generally do not include taxes charged for local 
benefits and improvements that increase the value of your property. These include assessments for 
streets, sidewalks, water mains, sewer lines, public parking facilities, and similar improvements. You 
should increase the basis of your property by the amount of the assessment. 
Local benefit taxes are deductible only if they are for maintenance, repair, or interest charges related 
to those benefits. If only a part of the taxes is for maintenance, repair, or interest, you must be able to 
show the amount of that part to claim the deduction. If you cannot determine what part of the tax is for 
maintenance, repair, or interest, none of it is deductible. 
Taxes for local benefits may be included in your real estate tax bill. If your taxing authority (or mortgage 
lender) does not furnish you a copy of your real estate tax bill, ask for it. You should use the rules above 
to determine if the local benefit tax is deductible.
Itemized charges for services. An itemized charge for services assessed against specific property or 
certain people is not a tax, even if the charge is paid to the taxing authority. For example, you cannot 
deduct the charge as a real estate tax if it is:
• A unit fee for the delivery of a service (such as a $5 fee charged for every 1,000 gallons 
of water you use),

 323  •  Chapter 23: Taxes
• A periodic charge for a residential service (such as a $20 per month or $240 annual fee 
charged to each homeowner for trash collection), or
• A flat fee charged for a single service provided by your government (such as a $30 charge 
for mowing your lawn because it was allowed to grow higher than permitted under your 
local ordinance).
Caution!
You must look at your real estate tax bill to determine if any nondeductible itemized 
charges, such as those listed above, are included in the bill. If your taxing authority (or 
mortgage lender) does not furnish you a copy of your real estate tax bill, ask for it.
Exception
Service charges used to maintain or improve services (such as trash collection or police 
and fire protection) are deductible as real estate taxes if:
• The fees or charges are imposed at a like rate against all property in the 
taxing jurisdiction,
• The funds collected are not earmarked; instead, they are commingled 
with general revenue funds, and
• Funds  used  to  maintain  or  improve  services  are  not  limited  to  or 
determined by the amount of these fees or charges collected.
Transfer taxes (or stamp taxes). Transfer taxes and similar taxes and charges on the sale of a personal 
home are not deductible. If they are paid by the seller, they are expenses of the sale and reduce the 
amount realized on the sale. If paid by the buyer, they are included in the cost basis of the property. 
Rent increase due to higher real estate taxes. If your landlord increases your rent in the form of a tax 
surcharge because of increased real estate taxes, you cannot deduct the increase as taxes. 
Homeowners’ association charges. These charges are not deductible because they are imposed by 
the homeowners’ association, rather than the state or local government.

 324  •  Chapter 23: Taxes
VII. PERSONAL PROPERTY TAXES 
Personal property tax is deductible if it is a state or local tax that is:
1. Charged on personal property,
2. Based only on the value of the personal property, and
3. Charged on a yearly basis, even if it is collected more than once a year, or less than once 
a year.
A tax that meets the above requirements can be considered charged on personal property even if it is for 
the exercise of a privilege. For example, a yearly tax based on value qualifies as a personal property tax 
even if it is called a registration fee and is for the privilege of registering motor vehicles or using them on 
the highways.
If the tax is partly based on value and partly based on other criteria, it may qualify in part. 
Example
Your state charges a yearly motor vehicle registration tax of 1% of value plus 50 cents 
per hundredweight. You paid $32 based on the value ($1,500) and weight (3,400 lbs.) of 
your car. You can deduct $15 (1% × $1,500) as a personal property tax, since it is based 
on the value. The remaining $17 ($.50 × 34), based on the weight, is not deductible.
VIII. TAXES AND FEES THAT CANNOT BE DEDUCTED 
Many federal, state, and local government taxes are not deductible because they do not fall within the 
categories discussed earlier. Other taxes and fees, such as federal income taxes, are not deductible 
because the tax law specifically prohibits a deduction for them. 
Taxes and fees that are generally not deductible include the following items. 
• Employment  taxes.  This  includes  social  security, Medicare,  and  railroad  retirement 
taxes withheld from your pay. However, you can take a deduction for the deductible part 
of self-employment tax. In addition, the social security and other employment taxes you 
pay on the wages of a household worker may be included in medical expenses that you 
can deduct or childcare expenses that allow you to claim the child and dependent care 
credit. For more information, see chapters 22 and 31.
• Estate,  inheritance,  legacy,  or  succession  taxes.  You  can  deduct  the  estate  tax  
attributable to income in respect of a decedent if you, as a beneficiary, must include that 
income in your gross income. In that case, deduct the estate tax on Schedule A (Form 
1040), line 16.  
• Federal income taxes. This includes taxes withheld from your pay. 

 325  •  Chapter 23: Taxes
• Fines  and  penalties.  You cannot deduct fines and penalties paid to a government for 
violation of any law, including related amounts forfeited as collateral deposits.
• Foreign personal or real property taxes.
• Gift taxes.  
• License fees. You cannot deduct license fees for personal purposes (such as marriage, 
driver’s, and pet license fees).
• Per capita taxes. You cannot deduct state or local per capita taxes.
Many taxes and fees other than those listed above are also nondeductible, unless they are ordinary and 
necessary expenses of a business or income producing activity. For other nondeductible items, see Real 
Estate-Related Items You Cannot Deduct, earlier.
IX. WHERE TO DEDUCT 
You deduct taxes on the following schedules. 
State and local income taxes. These taxes are deducted on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 5a even if 
your only source of income is from business, rents, or royalties.
Limitation on deduction for state and local taxes. The deduction for state and local taxes is limited to 
$10,000 ($5,000 if married filing married separately). State and local taxes are the taxes that you include 
on Schedule A (Form 1040), lines 5a, 5b, and 5c. Include taxes imposed by a U.S. possession with your 
state and local taxes on Schedule A (Form 1040), lines 5a, 5b, and 5c. However, do not include any U.S. 
possession taxes you paid that are allocable to excluded income.
Tip
 
You may want to take a credit for U.S. possession tax instead of a deduction. See the 
instructions for Schedule 3 (Form 1040), line 1, for details.
General sales taxes. Sales taxes are deducted on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 5a. You must check

Schedule A (Form 1040), line 5a.
Foreign income taxes. Generally, income taxes you pay to a foreign country or U.S. possession can

CHAPTER 23: SOLUTIONS AND SUGGESTED RESPONSES
Below are the solutions and suggested responses for the questions on the previous page(s). If you 
choose an incorrect answer, you should review the pages as indicated for each question to ensure 
comprehension of the material.
1.A. CORRECT. Federal income taxes paid are not deductible on federal personal income 
tax returns – Form 1040 or 1040-SR.
B. Incorrect. State income taxes, among other types of taxes and fees, are deductible for 
federal income tax purposes up to the SALT limitation.
C. Incorrect. Local income taxes can be deducted up to the SALT limitation.
D. Incorrect. Foreign income taxes are generally deductible on a U.S. Form 1040 return 
up to the SALT limitation. This deduction assumes that foreign income taxes were paid

CHAPTER 24: INTEREST EXPENSE
Chapter Objective
After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• Recall what types of interest you can and cannot deduct.
I.   REMINDERS
Home equity loan interest. No matter when the indebtedness was incurred, you can no longer deduct 
the interest from a loan secured by your home to the extent the loan proceeds were not used to buy, 
build, or substantially improve your home.
Home mortgage interest. You can deduct mortgage interest on the first $750,000 ($375,000 if married 
filing separately) of indebtedness. However, higher limitations ($1 million ($500,000 if filing separately)) 
apply if you are deducting mortgage interest from indebtedness incurred before December 16, 2017.
Mortgage insurance premiums. The itemized deduction for mortgage insurance premiums expired on 
December 31, 2021. 
II. INTRODUCTION 
This chapter discusses what interest expenses you can deduct. Interest is the amount you pay for the 
use of borrowed money. 
The types of interest you can deduct as itemized deductions on Schedule A (Form 1040) are: 
• Home mortgage interest, including certain points and mortgage insurance premiums, and 
• Investment interest. 
This chapter explains these deductions. It also explains where to deduct other types of interest and lists 
some types of interest you cannot deduct.
Use Table 24-1 to find out where to get more information on various types of interest, including investment 
interest. 

 331  •  Chapter 24: Interest Expense
III. HOME MORTGAGE INTEREST 
Generally, home mortgage interest is any interest you pay on a loan secured by your home (main home 
or a second home). The loan may be a mortgage to buy your home or a second mortgage. 
You can deduct home mortgage interest only if you meet all the following conditions. 
• You file Form 1040 or 1040-SR and itemize deductions on Schedule A (Form 1040).
• The mortgage is a secured debt on a qualified home in which you have an ownership 
interest. (Generally, your mortgage is a secured debt if you put your home up as collateral 
to protect the interests of the lender. The term “qualified home” means your main home or 
second home.) 
Both you and the lender must intend that the loan be repaid.
AMOUNT DEDUCTIBLE 
Note
Interest on home equity loans and lines of credit are deductible only if the borrowed 
funds are used to buy, build, or substantially improve the taxpayer’s home that secures 
the loan. The loan must be secured by the taxpayer’s main home or second home 
(qualified residence), not exceed the cost of the home, and meet other requirements.
In most cases, you will be able to deduct all of your home mortgage interest. How much you can deduct 
depends on the date of the mortgage, the amount of the mortgage, and how you use the mortgage 
proceeds. 
Fully deductible interest. If all of your mortgages fit into one or more of the following three categories 
at all times during the year, you can deduct all of the interest on those mortgages. (If any one mortgage 
fits into more than one category, add the debt that fits in each category to your other debt in the same 
category.) 
The three categories are as follows:  
1. Mortgages you took out on or before October 13, 1987 (called grandfathered debt). 
2. Mortgages you (or your spouse if married filing a joint return) took out after October 13, 
1987, and prior to December 16, 2017 (but see binding contract exception below) to 
buy, build, or substantially improve your home (called home acquisition debt), but only if 
throughout 2024 these mortgages plus any grandfathered debt totaled $1 million or less 
($500,000 or less if married filing separately). 
Exception. A taxpayer who enters into a written binding contract before December 15, 
2017, to close on the purchase of a principal residence before January 1, 2018, and who 

 332  •  Chapter 24: Interest Expense
purchases such residence before April 1, 2018, is considered to have incurred the home 
acquisition debt prior to December 16, 2017.
3. Mortgages you (or your spouse if married filing a joint return) took out after December 15, 
2017, to buy, build, or substantially improve your home (called home acquisition debt), but 
only if throughout 2024 these mortgages plus any grandfathered debt totaled $750,000 or 
less ($375,000 or less if married filing separately).
The dollar limits for the second and third categories apply to the combined mortgages on your main 
home and second home. 
You can use Figure 24-A to check whether your home mortgage interest is fully deductible. 
Limits  on  deduction. You cannot fully deduct interest on a mortgage that does not fit into any of the 
three categories listed above.

Special Situations
This section describes certain items that can be included as home mortgage  interest  and  others  that  
cannot. It also describes certain special situations that may affect your deduction.
Late  payment  charge  on  mortgage  payment.  You  can  deduct  as  home  mortgage  interest  a  late  
payment charge if it was not for a specific service performed in connection with your mortgage loan.
Mortgage prepayment penalty. If you pay off your home mortgage early, you may have to pay a penalty. 
You can deduct that penalty as home mortgage interest provided the penalty is not for a specific service 
performed or cost incurred in connection with your mortgage loan. 
Sale of home. If you sell your home, you can deduct your home mortgage interest (subject to any limits 
that apply) paid up to, but not including, the date of sale. 
Example
John and Peggy Harris sold their home on May 7. Through April 30, they made home 
mortgage interest payments of $1,220. The settlement sheet for the sale of the home 
showed $50 interest for the 6-day period in May up to, but not including, the date of 
sale. Their mortgage interest deduction is $1,270 ($1,220 + $50). 
Prepaid interest. If you pay interest in advance for a period that goes beyond the end of the tax year, 
you must spread this interest over the tax years to which it applies. You can deduct in each year only the 
interest that qualifies as home mortgage interest for that year. However, see Points, later. 
Mortgage  interest  credit. You  may  be  able  to  claim  a mortgage  interest  credit  if  you  were  issued  
a mortgage credit certificate (MCC) by a state or local government. Figure the credit on Form 8396, 
Mortgage Interest Credit. If you take this credit, you must reduce your mortgage interest deduction by 
the amount of the credit.
Ministers’ and military housing allowance. If you are a minister or a member of the uniformed services 
and receive a housing allowance that is not taxable, you can still deduct your home mortgage interest.
Mortgage  assistance  payments.  If  you  qualify  for  mortgage  assistance  payments  for  lower-income  
families under section 235 of the National Housing Act, part or all of the interest on your mortgage may 
be paid for you. You cannot deduct the interest that is paid for you.
No other effect on taxes. Do not include these mortgage assistance payments in your income. Also, do 
not use these payments to reduce other deductions, such as real estate taxes. 
Divorced or separated individuals. If a qualified pre-2019 divorce or separation agreement requires 
you or your spouse or former spouse to pay home mortgage interest on a home owned by both of you, 
the payment of interest may be alimony.  See  the  discussion  of  Payments  for  jointly-owned  home  in  
chapter 18. 

 334  •  Chapter 24: Interest Expense
Redeemable ground rents. If you make annual or periodic rental payments on a redeemable ground 
rent, you can deduct them as mortgage interest. 
Payments made to end the lease and to buy the lessor’s entire interest in the land are not deductible as 
mortgage interest.
Nonredeemable ground rents. Payments on a nonredeemable ground rent are not mortgage interest. 
You can deduct them as rent if they are a business expense or if they are for rental property. 
Reverse mortgages. A reverse mortgage is a loan where the lender pays you (in a lump sum, a monthly 
advance, a line of credit, or a combination of all three) while you continue to live in your home. With a 
reverse mortgage, you retain title to your home. Depending on the plan, your reverse mortgage becomes 
due with interest when you move, sell your home, reach the end of a pre-selected loan period, or die. 
Because reverse mortgages are considered loan advances and not income, the amount you receive is 
not taxable. Generally, any interest (including original issue discount) accrued on a reverse mortgage is 
considered home equity debt and is not deductible. 
Rental  payments. If you live in a house before final settlement on the purchase, any payments you 
make for that period are rent and not interest. This is true even if the settlement papers call them interest. 
You cannot deduct these payments as home mortgage interest. 
Mortgage  proceeds  invested  in  tax-exempt  securities.  You  cannot  deduct  the  home  mortgage 
interest on grandfathered debt or home equity debt if you used the proceeds of the mortgage to buy 
securities or certificates that produce tax-free income.  
Refunds of interest. If you receive a refund of interest in the same tax year you paid it, you must reduce 
your interest expense by the amount refunded to you. If you receive a refund of interest you deducted 
in an earlier year, you generally must include the refund in income in the year you receive it. However, 
you need to include it only up to the amount of the deduction that reduced your tax in the earlier year. 
This is true whether the interest overcharge was refunded to you or was used to reduce the outstanding 
principal on your mortgage. If you need to include the refund in income, report it on Schedule 1 (Form 
1040), line 8z.
If you received a refund of interest you overpaid in an earlier year, you generally will receive a Form 
1098, Mortgage Interest Statement, showing the refund in box 4. For information about Form 1098, see 
Mortgage Interest Statement, later. 
POINTS  
The term “points” is used to describe certain charges paid, or treated as paid, by a borrower to obtain a 
home mortgage. Points may also be called loan origination fees, maximum loan charges, loan discount, 
or discount points. 
A borrower is treated as paying any points that a home seller pays for the borrower’s mortgage. See 
Points paid by the seller, later. 

 335  •  Chapter 24: Interest Expense
General rule. You generally cannot deduct the full amount of points in the year paid. Because they are 
prepaid interest, you generally must deduct them over the life (term) of the mortgage. If the loan is a 
home equity, line of credit, or credit card loan and the proceeds from the loan are not used to buy, build, 
or substantially improve the home, the points are not deductible.
Deduction Allowed in Year Paid 
You can fully deduct points in the year paid if you meet all the following tests. (You can use Figure 24-B 
as a quick guide to see whether your points are fully deductible in the year paid.)  
1. Your loan is secured by your main home. (Your main home is the one you ordinarily live 
in most of the time.)
2. Paying points is an established business practice in the area where the loan was made. 
3. The points paid were not more than the points generally charged in that area.
4. You use the cash method of accounting. This means you report income in the year you 
receive it and deduct expenses in the year you pay them. 
5. The points were not paid in place of amounts that ordinarily are stated separately on the 
settlement statement, such as appraisal fees, inspection fees, title fees, attorney fees, 
and property taxes. 
6. The funds you provided at or before closing, plus any points the seller paid, were at least 
as much as the points charged. The funds you provided are not required to have been 
applied to the points. They can include a down payment, an escrow deposit, earnest 
money, and other funds you paid at or before closing for any purpose. You cannot have 
borrowed these funds from your lender or mortgage broker. 
7. You use your loan to buy or build your main home. 
8. The points were figured as a percentage of the principal amount of the mortgage. 
9. The amount is clearly shown on the settlement statement (such as the Uniform Settlement 
Statement, Form HUD-1) as points charged for the mortgage. The points may be shown 
as paid from either your funds or the seller’s.
Note
 
If you meet all of these tests, you can choose to either fully deduct the points in the year 
paid, or deduct them over the life of the loan.

 336  •  Chapter 24: Interest Expense
FIGURE 24-B. ARE MY POINTS FULLY DEDUCTIBLE THIS YEAR?

 337  •  Chapter 24: Interest Expense
Home improvement loan. You can also fully deduct in the year paid points paid on a loan to improve 
your main home, if tests (1) through (6) are met.
Caution!
 
Second  home. You cannot fully deduct in the year paid points you pay on loans 
secured by your second home. You can deduct these points only over the life of the loan.
Refinancing. Generally, points you pay to refinance a mortgage are not deductible in full in the year you 
pay them. This is true even if the new mortgage is secured by your main home. 
However, if you use part of the refinanced mortgage proceeds to improve your main home and you meet 
the first six tests listed under Deduction Allowed in Year Paid, earlier, you can fully deduct the part of the 
points related to the improvement in the year you paid them with your own funds. You can deduct the 
rest of the points over the life of the loan. 
Example 1
In 2001, Bill Fields got a mortgage to buy a home. In 2024, Bill refinanced that mortgage 
with a 15-year $100,000 mortgage loan. The mortgage is secured by his home. To 
get the new loan, he had to pay three points ($3,000). Two points ($2,000) were for 
prepaid interest, and one point ($1,000) was charged for services, in place of amounts 
that ordinarily are stated separately on the settlement statement. Bill paid the points 
out of his private funds, rather than out of the proceeds of the new loan. The payment of 
points is an established practice in the area, and the points charged are not more than 
the amount generally charged there. Bill’s first payment on the new loan was due July 
1. He made six payments on the loan in 2024 and is a cash-basis taxpayer.
Bill used the funds from the new mortgage to repay his existing mortgage. Although the 
new mortgage loan was for Bill’s continued ownership of his main home, it was not for 
the purchase or improvement of that home. He cannot deduct all of the points in 2024. 
He can deduct two points ($2,000) ratably over the life of the loan. He deducts $67 
[($2,000 ÷ 180 months) × 6 payments] of the points in 2024. The other point ($1,000) 
was a fee for services and is not deductible.

 338  •  Chapter 24: Interest Expense
Example 2
The facts are the same as in Example  1, except that Bill used $25,000 of the loan 
proceeds to improve his home and $75,000 to repay his existing mortgage. Bill deducts 
25% ($25,000 ÷ $100,000) of the points ($2,000) in 2024. His deduction is $500 
($2,000 × 25%).
Bill also deducts the ratable part of the remaining $1,500 ($2,000 - $500) that must be 
spread over the life of the loan. This is $50 [($1,500 ÷ 180 months) × 6 payments] in 
2024. The total amount Bill deducts in 2023 is $550 ($500 + $50). 
Deduction Allowed Ratably
If you do not meet the tests listed under Deduction Allowed in Year Paid, earlier, the loan is not a home 
improvement loan, or you choose not to deduct your points in full in the year paid, you can deduct the 
points ratably (equally) over the life of the loan if you meet all the following tests.
1. You  use  the  cash  method  of  accounting.  This  means  you  report  income  in  the  year  
you receive it and deduct expenses in the year you pay them. Most individuals use this 
method.
2. Your loan is secured by a home. (The home does not need to be your main home.)
3. Your loan period is not more than 30 years.
4. If your loan period is more than 10 years, the terms of your loan are the same as other 
loans offered in your area for the same or longer period.
5. Either your loan amount is $250,000 or less, or the number of points is not more than:
a) 4, if your loan period is 15 years or less, or
b) 6, if your loan period is more than 15 years.
Special Situations
This section describes certain special situations that may affect your deduction of points.
Original issue discount. If you do not qualify to either deduct the points in the year paid or deduct them 
ratably over the life of the loan, or if you choose not to use either of these methods, the points reduce the 
issue price of the loan. This reduction results in original issue discount.
Amounts charged for services. Amounts charged by the lender for specific services connected to the 
loan are not interest. Examples of these charges are:  
1. Appraisal fees, 
2. Notary fees,  

 339  •  Chapter 24: Interest Expense
3. Preparation costs for the mortgage note or deed of trust,
4. Mortgage insurance premiums, and
5. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) funding fees.
You cannot deduct these amounts as points either in the year paid or over the life of the mortgage. 
Points  paid  by  the  seller.  The  term  “points”  includes  loan  placement  fees  that  the  seller  pays  to  the  
lender to arrange financing for the buyer. 
Treatment by seller. The seller cannot deduct these fees as interest. But they are a selling expense that 
reduces the amount realized by the seller. See chapter 15 for information on the sale of your home. 
Treatment by buyer. The buyer reduces the basis of the home by the amount of the seller-paid points 
and treats the points as if he or she had paid them. If all the tests under Deductible Allowed in Year Paid, 
earlier, are met, the buyer can deduct the points in the year paid. If any of those tests are not met, the 
buyer deducts the points over the life of the loan. For information about basis, see chapter 13. 
Funds  provided  are  less  than  points.  If  you  meet  all  the  tests  in  Deduction  Allowed  in  Year  Paid, 
earlier, except that the funds you provided were less than the points charged to you (test 6), you can 
deduct the points in the year paid, up to the amount of funds you provided. In addition, you can deduct 
any points paid by the seller. 
Example 1
When you took out a $100,000 mortgage loan to buy your home in December, you were 
charged one point ($1,000). You meet all the tests for deducting points in the year paid, 
except the only funds you provided were a $750 down payment. Of the $1,000 charged 
for points, you can deduct $750 in the year paid. You spread the remaining $250 over 
the life of the mortgage. 
Example 2
The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the person who sold you your home 
also paid one point ($1,000) to help you get your mortgage. In the year paid, you can 
deduct $1,750 ($750 of the amount you were charged plus the $1,000 paid by the 
seller). You spread the remaining $250 over the life of the mortgage. You must reduce 
the basis of your home by the $1,000 paid by the seller. 
Excess points. If you meet all the tests in Deduction Allowed in Year Paid, earlier, except that the points 
paid were more than are generally paid in your area (test 3), you deduct in the year paid only the points 
that are generally charged. You must spread any additional points over the life of the mortgage. 

 340  •  Chapter 24: Interest Expense
Mortgage ending early. If you spread your deduction for points over the life of the mortgage, you can 
deduct any remaining balance in the year the mortgage ends. However, if you refinance the mortgage 
with the same lender, you cannot deduct any remaining balance of spread points. Instead, deduct the 
remaining balance over the term of the new loan. 
A mortgage may end early due to a prepayment, refinancing, foreclosure, or similar event. 
Example
Dan paid $3,000 in points in 2012 that he had to spread out over the 15-year life of the 
mortgage. He deducts $200 of the points per year. Through 2024, Dan has deducted 
$2,200 of the points.
Dan prepaid his mortgage in full in 2024. He can deduct the remaining $800 of points 
in 2024. 
Limits on deduction. You cannot fully deduct points on a mortgage unless the mortgage fits into one of 
the categories listed earlier under Fully deductible interest. 
FORM 1098, MORTGAGE INTEREST STATEMENT 
If  you  paid  $600  or  more  of  mortgage  interest  (including  certain  points)  during  the  year  on  any  one  
mortgage, you generally will receive a Form 1098, Mortgage Interest Statement, or a similar statement 
from  the  mortgage  holder.  You  will  receive  the  statement  if  you  pay  interest  to  a  person  (including  a  
financial institution or a cooperative housing corporation) in the course of that person’s trade or business. 
A governmental unit is a person for purposes of furnishing the statement. 
You should receive the statement for each year by January 31 of the following year. A copy of this form 
will also be sent to the IRS. 
The statement will show the total interest you paid during the year, and if you purchased a principal 
residence during the year, it will also show the points paid during the year, including seller-paid points 
that are deductible as interest to the extent you do not exceed the home acquisition debt limit. However, 
it should not show any interest that was paid for you by a government agency. 
As a general rule, Form 1098 will include only points that you can fully deduct in the year paid. However, 
it may report points that you cannot deduct, particularly if you are filing married filing separately or have 
mortgages for multiple properties. You must take care to deduct only those points legally allowable. 
Additionally, certain points not included on Form 1098 also may be deductible, either in the year paid or 
over the life of the loan. See Points, earlier, to determine whether you can deduct points not shown on 
Form 1098. 
Prepaid interest on Form 1098. If you prepaid interest in 2024 that accrued in full by January 15, 2025, 
this prepaid interest may be included in box 1 of Form 1098. However, you cannot deduct the prepaid 
amount for January 2025 in 2024. (See Prepaid interest, earlier.) You will have to figure the interest that 
accrued for 2025 and subtract it from the amount in box 1. You will include the interest for January 2025 
with the other interest you pay for 2025. See How to Report, later. 

 341  •  Chapter 24: Interest Expense
I V.  INVESTMENT INTEREST 
This section discusses the interest expenses you may be able to deduct as an investor. 
If you borrow money to buy property you hold for investment, the interest you pay is investment interest. 
You can deduct investment interest subject to the limit discussed later. However, you cannot deduct 
interest you incurred to produce tax-exempt income. Nor can you deduct interest expenses on straddles. 
Investment interest does not include any qualified home mortgage interest or any interest taken into 
account in computing income or loss from a passive activity. 
INVESTMENT PROPERTY 
Property held for investment includes property that produces interest, dividends, annuities, or royalties 
not derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business. It also includes property that produces gain 
or loss (not derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business) from the sale or trade of property 
producing  these  types  of  income  or  held  for  investment  (other  than  an  interest  in  a  passive  activity).  
Investment property also includes an interest in a trade or business activity in which you did not materially 
participate (other than a passive activity). 
Partners,  shareholders,  and  beneficiaries. To  determine  your  investment  interest,  combine  your 
share of investment interest from a partnership, S corporation, estate, or trust with your other investment 
interest. 
ALLOCATION OF INTEREST EXPENSE 
If you borrow money for business or personal purposes as well as for investment, you must allocate 
the debt among those purposes. Only the interest expense on the part of the debt used for investment 
purposes is treated as investment interest. The allocation is not affected by the use of property that 
secures the debt. 
LIMIT ON DEDUCTION 
Generally, your deduction for investment interest expense is limited to the amount of your net investment 
income. 
You can carry over the amount of investment interest that you could not deduct because of this limit to 
the next tax year. The interest carried over is treated as investment interest paid or accrued in that next 
year. 
You can carry over disallowed investment interest to the next tax year even if it is more than your taxable 
income in the year the interest was paid or accrued. 
Net Investment Income 
Determine the amount of your net investment income by subtracting your investment expenses (other 
than interest expense) from your investment income. 

 342  •  Chapter 24: Interest Expense
Investment income. This generally includes your gross income from property held for investment (such 
as interest, dividends, annuities, and royalties). Investment income does not include Alaska Permanent 
Fund dividends. It also does not include qualified dividends  or  net  capital  gain  unless  you  choose  to  
include them.
Choosing to include qualified dividends.  Investment  income  generally  does  not  include  qualified 
dividends, discussed in chapter 8. However, you can choose to include all or part of your qualified 
dividends in investment income.
You make this choice by completing Form 4952, line 4g, according to its instructions.
If you choose to include any amount of your qualified dividends in investment income, you must reduce 
your qualified dividends that are eligible for the lower capital gains tax rates by the same amount.
Choosing to include net capital gain. Investment income generally does not include net capital gain 
from disposing of investment property (including capital gain distributions from mutual funds). However, 
you can choose to include all or part of your net capital gain in investment income. You make this choice 
by completing line 4g of Form 4952 according to its instructions. 
If you choose to include any amount of your net capital gain in investment income, you must reduce your 
net capital gain that is eligible for the lower capital gains tax rates by the same amount. 
Tip
Before making either choice, consider the overall effect on your tax liability. Compare 
your tax if you make one or both of these choices with your tax if you do not make either 
choice.
Investment income of child reported on parent’s return. Investment income includes the part of your 
child’s interest and dividend income that you choose to report on your return. If the child does not have 
qualified dividends, Alaska Permanent Fund dividends, or capital gain distributions, this is the amount on 
line 6 of Form 8814, Parents’ Election To Report Child’s Interest and Dividends. Include it on line 4a of 
Form 4952.
Child’s qualified dividends. If part of the amount you report is your child’s qualified dividends, that part 
(which is reported on Form 1040, line 3a) generally does not count as investment income. However, 
you can choose to include all or part of it in investment income, as explained under Choosing to include 
qualified dividends, earlier.

 343  •  Chapter 24: Interest Expense
Your investment income also includes the amount on Form 8814, line 12 (or, if applicable, the reduced 
amount figured next under Child’s Alaska Permanent Fund dividends).
Child’s  Alaska  Permanent  Fund  dividends. If part of the amount you report is your child’s Alaska 
Permanent Fund dividends, that part does not count as investment income. To figure the amount of your 
child’s income that you can consider your investment income, start with the amount on Form 8814, line 
6. Multiply that amount by a percentage that is equal to the Alaska Permanent Fund dividends divided by 
the total amount on Form 8814, line 4. Subtract the result from the amount on Form 8814, line 12.
Child’s capital  gain  distributions.  If  part  of  the  amount  you  report  is  your  child’s  capital  gain  
distributions, that part (which is reported on Schedule D (Form 1040), line 13, or Form 1040, line 7) 
generally does not count as investment income. However, you can choose to include all or part of it in 
investment income. Your investment income also includes the amount on line 12 of Form 8814.
Form 4952 
Use Form 4952, Investment Interest Expense Deduction, to figure your deduction for investment interest. 
Exception to use of Form 4952. You do not have to complete Form 4952 or attach it to your return if 
you meet all of the following tests. 
• Your  investment  income  from  interest  and  ordinary  dividends  minus  any  qualified 
dividends is more than your investment interest expense. 
• You have no other deductible investment expenses. 
• You have no carryover of investment interest expense from 2023. 
If you meet all of these tests, you can deduct all of your investment interest. 
V.   ITEMS YOU CANNOT DEDUCT 
Some interest payments are not deductible. Certain expenses similar to interest also are not deductible. 
Nondeductible expenses include the following items. 
• Personal interest (discussed later). 
• Annual fees for credit cards. 
• Loan fees. 
• Credit investigation fees.
• VA funding fees.
• Interest to purchase or carry tax-exempt securities. 

 344  •  Chapter 24: Interest Expense
Penalties. You cannot deduct fines and penalties paid to a government for violations of law, regardless 
of their nature. 
PERSONAL INTEREST 
Personal interest is not deductible. Personal interest is any interest that is not home mortgage interest, 
investment interest, business interest, or other deductible interest. It includes the following items. 
• Interest on car loans (unless you use the car for business). 
• Interest on federal, state, or local income tax.
• Finance  charges  on  credit  cards,  retail  installment  contracts,  and  revolving  charge 
accounts incurred for personal expenses. 
• Late payment charges by a public utility.
Tip
 
You may be able to deduct interest you pay on a qualified student loan.
VI. ALLOCATION OF INTEREST 
If you use the proceeds of a loan for more than one purpose (for example, personal and business), you 
must allocate the interest on the loan to each use. However, you do not have to allocate home mortgage 
interest if it is fully deductible, regardless of how the funds are used. 
You allocate interest (other than fully deductible home mortgage interest) on a loan in the same way as 
the loan itself is allocated. You do this by tracing disbursements of the debt proceeds to specific uses.
VII. HOW TO REPORT
You must file Form 1040 or 1040-SR to deduct any home mortgage interest expense on your tax return. 
Where  you  deduct  your  interest  expense  generally  depends  on  how  you  use  the  loan  proceeds.  See  
Table 24-1 for a summary of where to deduct your interest expense.

 345  •  Chapter 24: Interest Expense

Personal interestNot Deductible
Home mortgage interest and points. Generally, you can deduct the home mortgage interest and points 
reported to you on Form 1098 on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 8a. However, any interest showing in box 
1 of Form 1098 from a home equity loan, or a line of credit or credit card loan secured by the property is 
not deductible if the proceeds were not used to buy, build, or substantially improve a qualified home. If 
you paid more deductible interest to the financial institution than the amount shown on Form 1098, show 
the portion of the deductible interest that was omitted from Form 1098 on line 8b. Attach a statement 
explaining the difference and enter “See attached” next to line 8b.
If you can take a deduction for points that were not reported to you on Form 1098, deduct those points 
on line 8c of Schedule A (Form 1040).
More than one borrower. If you and at least one other person (other than your spouse if you file a joint 
return) were liable for and paid interest on a mortgage that was for your home, and the other person 
received a Form 1098 showing the interest that was paid during the year, attach a statement to your 
return explaining this. Show how much of the interest each of you paid, and give the name and address 
of the person who received the form. Deduct your share of the interest on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 
8b, and enter “See attached” next to the line.  
Similarly, if you are the payer of record on a mortgage on which there are other borrowers entitled to a 
deduction for the interest shown on the Form 1098 you received, deduct only your share of the interest 
on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 8a. You should let each of the other borrowers know what his or her 
share is. 
Mortgage proceeds used for business. If your home mortgage interest deduction is limited but all or 
part of the mortgage proceeds were used for business or other deductible activities, see Table 24-1. It 
shows where to deduct the part of your excess interest that is for those activities.
Investment interest. Deduct investment interest, subject to certain limits, on Schedule A (Form 1040), 
line 9. 

 346  •  Chapter 24: Interest Expense
Amortization of bond premium. There are various ways to treat the premium you pay to buy taxable 
bonds. 
Income-producing rental or royalty interest. Deduct interest on a loan for income-producing rental or 
royalty property that is not used in your business in Part I of Schedule E (Form 1040). 
Example
You rent out part of your home and borrow money to make repairs. You can deduct 
only the interest payment for the rented part in Part I of Schedule E (Form 1040). 
Deduct the rest of the interest payment on Schedule A (Form 1040) if it is deductible 
home mortgage interest.

B. both you and the lender must intend that the loan be repaid
C. the mortgage must be a secured debt on a qualified home
D. the mortgage(s) have a combined balance exceeding $1 million
2.
Why are points paid to obtain a home mortgage generally not deductible in 
the year paid:
A. because points are not an established business practice

CHAPTER 24: SOLUTIONS AND SUGGESTED RESPONSES
Below are the solutions and suggested responses for the questions on the previous page(s). If you 
choose an incorrect answer, you should review the pages as indicated for each question to ensure 
comprehension of the material.
1.A. Incorrect. You may be able to fully deduct home mortgage interest if certain conditions 
are met. Filing Form 1040 or 1040-SR with itemized deductions is one of the necessary 
conditions.
B. Incorrect.  The  condition  of  intention  of  repayment  for  the  home  mortgage  loan  is  a  
necessary condition for claiming the home mortgage interest deduction.
C. Incorrect. The mortgage producing the intended interest expense to be deducted must 
be secured by a qualified home.
D. CORRECT. Mortgage interest paid resulting from mortgage balances exceeding $1 
million ($500,000 for married filing separately) do not qualify for full deductibility. The 
$1 million was lowered to $750,000 ($375,000 for married filing separately) for new 
mortgages taken out after December 15, 2017.
(See pages 336 to 337 of the course material.) 
2.A. Incorrect. The deductibility of points is not directly related to a local business practice.
B. Incorrect. Points are computed as a percentage of the principal amount of the borrowed 
funds, or mortgage. This calculation however has no relationship to the deductibility of 
these costs on a federal tax return.
C. Incorrect. The listing of “points” on a standard closing statement (Form HUD-1) has no 
connection to their deductibility.
D. CORRECT.  The  general  rule  is  that  points  represent  prepaid  interest  and  therefore  
must be claimed over the life of the mortgage. However, a nine-point exception test 
exists  that  upon  meeting  all  such  conditions  will  allow  a  taxpayer  to  fully  deduct  all  
points paid in the same year as they were paid.
(See pages 339 to 340 of the course material.)

 351  •  Chapter 24: Interest Expense
3.A. Incorrect. Generally, your deduction for investment interest expense is not limited to the 
amount of your AGI, but rather your net investment income.
B. Incorrect. Generally, your deduction for investment interest expense is not limited to the 
amount of your taxable income, but rather your net investment income.
C. CORRECT. Your deduction for investment interest expense is limited to the amount of 
your net investment income. You can carry over the amount of investment interest that 
you could not deduct in the current year because of this limit to the next tax year. 
D. Incorrect. Generally, your deduction for investment interest expense is not limited to t he 
amount of your net capital gain, but rather your net investment income.

CHAPTER 25: CONTRIBUTIONS
Chapter Objective
After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• Recall the types of charitable contributions you can deduct and the records you should keep.
I.   INTRODUCTION 
This chapter explains how to claim a deduction for your charitable contributions. It discusses: 
• The types of organizations to which you can make deductible charitable contributions, 
• The types of contributions you can deduct, 
• How much you can deduct, 
• What records to keep, and 
• How to report your charitable contributions. 
A charitable contribution is a donation or gift to, or for the use of, a qualified organization. It is voluntary 
and is made without getting, or expecting to get, anything of equal value. 
Schedule  A  (Form  1040)  required.  To  deduct  a  charitable contribution, you must itemize deductions 
on Schedule A (Form 1040). The amount of your deduction may be limited if certain rules and limits 
explained in this chapter apply to you.
II. ORGANIZATIONS  THAT  QUALIFY  TO  RECEIVE  DEDUCTIBLE  
CONTRIBUTIONS 
You can deduct your contributions only if you make them to a qualified organization. Most organizations, 
other than churches and governments, must apply to the IRS to become a qualified organization. 
TYPES OF QUALIFIED ORGANIZATIONS 
Generally, only the following types of organizations can be qualified organizations.
1. A community chest, corporation, trust, fund, or foundation organized or created in or under 
the laws of the United States, any state, the District of Columbia, or any possession of the 
United States (including Puerto Rico). It must, however, be organized and operated only 
for charitable, religious, scientific, literary, or educational purposes, or for the prevention 
of cruelty to children or animals. Certain organizations that foster national or international 
amateur sports competition also qualify.

 353  •  Chapter 25: Contributions
2. War veterans’ organizations, including posts, auxiliaries, trusts, or foundations, organized 
in the United States or any of its possessions (including Puerto Rico).
3. Domestic fraternal societies, orders, and associations operating under the lodge system.
4. Certain nonprofit cemetery companies or corporations.
5. The United States or any state, the District of Columbia, a U.S. possession (including 
Puerto Rico), a political subdivision of a state or U.S. possession, or an Indian tribal 
government or any of its subdivisions that perform substantial government functions.
Qualified organizations include: 
• Churches, a convention or association of churches, temples, synagogues, mosques, and 
other religious organizations. 
• Most nonprofit charitable organizations such as the American Red Cross and the United 
Way. 
• Most  nonprofit  educational  organizations,  including  the  Boy  Scouts  of  America,  Girl 
Scouts of America, colleges, and museums. This also includes nonprofit daycare centers 
that provide childcare to the general public if substantially all the childcare is provided 
to enable parents and guardians to be gainfully employed. However, if your contribution 
is  a  substitute  for  tuition  or  other  enrollment  fee,  it  is  not  deductible  as  a  charitable 
contribution, as explained later under Contributions You Cannot Deduct. 
• Nonprofit hospitals and medical research organizations. 
• Utility  company  emergency  energy  programs,  if  the  utility  company  is  an  agent  for  a 
charitable organization that assists individuals with emergency energy needs. 
• Nonprofit volunteer fire companies. 
• Nonprofit organizations that develop and maintain public parks and recreation facilities. 
• Civil defense organizations. 
III. CONTRIBUTIONS YOU CAN DEDUCT 
Generally, you can deduct your contributions of money or property that you make to, or for the use of, a 
qualified organization. A  contribution is “for the use of” a qualified organization when it is held in a legally 
enforceable trust for the qualified organization or in a similar legal arrangement. The contributions must 
be made to a qualified organization and not set aside for use by a specific person.
If you give property to a qualified organization, you generally can deduct the fair market value of the 
property at the time of the contribution. See Contributions of Property, later in this chapter. 
Your deduction for charitable contributions generally cannot be more than 60% of your adjusted gross 
income, but in some cases 20%, 30%, or 50% limits may apply.

 354  •  Chapter 25: Contributions
Table 25-1 lists some examples of contributions you can deduct and some that you cannot deduct.
TABLE 25-1. EXAMPLES OF CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS – A QUICK CHECK
Use the following lists for a quick check of contributions you can or cannot deduct. See the rest of this 
chapter for more information and additional rules and limits that may apply.
Deductible as Charitable 
Contributions
Not Deductible as Charitable 
Contributions
Money or property you give to:
• Churches, synagogues, temples, mosques, 
and other religious organizations
• Federal, state and local governments, 
if your contribution is solely for public 
purposes (for example, a gift to reduce the 
public debt or maintain a public park)
• Nonprofit schools and hospitals
• Salvation Army, American Red Cross, 
CARE, Goodwill Industries, United Way, 
Boy Scouts of America, Girl Scouts of 
America, Boys and Girls Clubs of America, 
etc.
• War veterans groups
Expenses  paid  for  a  student  living  with  you, 
sponsored by a qualified organization
Out-of-pocket  expenses  when  you  serve  a 
qualified organization as a volunteer
Money or property you give to:
• Civic leagues, social and sports clubs, labor 
unions, and chambers of commerce
• Foreign organizations (except certain 
Canadian, Israeli, and Mexican charities)
• Groups that are run for personal profit
• Groups whose purpose is to lobby for law 
changes
• Homeowners’ associations
• Individuals
• Political groups or candidates for public 
office
Cost of raffle, bingo, or lottery tickets
Dues, fees, or bills paid to country clubs, lodges, 
fraternal orders, or similar groups
Tuition
Value of your time or services
Value of blood given to a blood bank
CONTRIBUTIONS FROM WHICH YOU BENEFIT 
If you receive a benefit as a result of making a contribution to a qualified organization, you can deduct 
only the amount of your contribution that is more than the value of the benefit you receive. 
If you pay more than fair market value to a qualified organization for goods or services, the excess may 
be a charitable contribution. For the excess amount to qualify, you must pay it with the intent to make a 
charitable contribution. 

 355  •  Chapter 25: Contributions
Example 1
You pay $65 for a ticket to a dinner dance at a church. Your entire $65 payment goes 
to the church. The ticket to the dinner-dance has a fair market value of $25. When you 
buy your ticket, you know that its value is less than your payment. To figure the amount 
of your charitable contribution, you subtract the value of the benefit you receive ($25) 
from your total payment ($65). You can deduct $40 as a contribution to the church. 
Example 2
At a fundraising auction conducted by a charity, you pay $600 for a week’s stay at a 
beach house. The amount you pay is no more than the fair rental value. You have not 
made a deductible charitable contribution. 
Charity benefit events. If you pay a qualified organization more than fair market value for the right 
to attend a charity ball, banquet, show, sporting event, or other benefit event, you can deduct only the 
amount that is more than the value of the privileges or other benefits you receive. 
If there is an established charge for the event, that charge is the value of your benefit. If there is no 
established charge, the reasonable value of the right to attend the event is the value of your benefit. 
Whether you use the tickets or other privileges has no effect on the amount you can deduct. However, if 
you return the ticket to the qualified organization for resale, you can deduct the entire amount you paid 
for the ticket. 
Example
You pay $40 to see a special showing of a movie for the benefit of a qualified organization. 
Printed on the ticket is “Contribution – $40.” If the regular price for the movie is $8, 
your contribution is $32 ($40 payment - $8 regular price). 
State  or  local  tax  credit  or  deduction.  If  you  receive  or  expect  to  receive  a  state  or  local  tax  credit  
or a state or local tax deduction for a charitable contribution, then the amount treated as a charitable 
deduction may be reduced.
Membership fees or dues. You may be able to deduct membership fees or dues you pay to a qualified 
organization. However, you can deduct only the amount that is more than the value of the benefits 
you  receive. You  cannot  deduct  dues,  fees,  or  assessments  paid  to  country  clubs  and  other  social 
organizations. They are not qualified organizations. 
Certain membership benefits can be disregarded. Both you and the organization can disregard the 
following membership benefits if you receive them in return for an annual payment of $75 or less:  

 356  •  Chapter 25: Contributions
1. Any rights or privileges that you can use frequently while you are a member, such as:  
a) Free or discounted admission to the organization’s facilities or events,
b) Free or discounted parking,
c) Preferred access to goods or services, and 
d) Discounts on the purchase of goods and services. 
2. Admission, while you are a member, to events that are open only to members of the 
organization, if the organization reasonably projects that the cost per person (excluding 
any allocated overhead) is not more than $12.50.  
Token items. You do not have to reduce your contribution by the value of any benefit you receive if both 
of the following are true.  
1. You receive only a small item or other benefit of token value. 
2. The qualified organization correctly determines that the value of the item or benefit you 
received is not substantial and informs you that you can deduct your payment in full.  
Written statement. A qualified organization must give you a written statement if you make a payment of 
more than $75 that is partly for goods or services. The statement must say that you can deduct only the 
amount of your payment that is more than the value of the goods or services you received. It must also 
give you a good faith estimate of the value of those goods or services. 
The organization can give you the statement either when it solicits or when it receives the payment from 
you. 
Exception
An organization will not have to give you this statement if one of the following is true. 
1. The organization is:
• A  governmental  organization  described  in  (5)  under Types   of   
Qualified Organizations, earlier, or
• An organization formed only for religious purposes, and the only 
benefit  you  receive  is  an  intangible  religious  benefit  (such  as 
admission  to  a  religious  ceremony)  that  generally  is  not  sold  in 
commercial transactions outside the donative context.
2. You receive only items whose value is not substantial. See Token items, 
earlier.
3. You  receive  only  membership  benefits  that  can  be  disregarded,  as 
described earlier.

 357  •  Chapter 25: Contributions
EXPENSES PAID FOR STUDENT LIVING WITH YOU 
You may be able to deduct some expenses of having a student live with you. You can deduct qualifying 
expenses for a foreign or American student who:  
1. Lives in your home under a written agreement between you and a qualified organization 
as  part  of  a  program  of  the  organization  to  provide  educational  opportunities  for  the  
student, 
2. Is not your dependent or relative, and 
3. Is a full-time student in the twelfth or any lower grade at a school in the United States. 
You can deduct up to $50 a month for each full calendar month the student lives with you. Any month 
when conditions (1) through (3) above are not met for 15 days or more counts as a full month. 
Mutual exchange program. You cannot deduct the costs of a foreign student living in your home under 
a mutual exchange program through which your child will live with a family in a foreign country.
OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES IN GIVING SERVICES 
Although you cannot deduct the value of your services given to a qualified organization, you may be able 
to deduct some amounts you pay in giving services to a qualified organization. The amounts must be: 
• Unreimbursed, 
• Directly connected with the services, 
• Expenses you had only because of the services you gave, and 
• Not personal, living, or family expenses. 
Table 25-2 contains questions and answers that apply to some individuals who volunteer their services.
TABLE 25-2. VOLUNTEERS’ QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
If you volunteer for a qualified organization, the following questions and answers may apply to you. All 
of the rules explained in this chapter also apply. See, in particular, Out-of-Pocket  Expenses  in  Giving  
Services.
QuestionAnswer
I  volunteer  6  hours  a  week  in  the  office  of  a 
qualified  organization. The  receptionist  is  paid 
$10 an hour to do the same work I do. Can I 
deduct $60 a week for my time?
No, you cannot deduct the value of your time or 
services.

 358  •  Chapter 25: Contributions
QuestionAnswer
The  office  is  30  miles  from  my  home.  Can  I 
deduct any of my car expenses for these trips?
Yes,  you  can  deduct  the  costs  of  gas  and  oil 
that  are  directly  related  to  getting  to  and  from  
the place where you are a volunteer. If you don’t 
want to figure your actual costs, you can deduct 
14 cents for each mile.
I  volunteer  as  a  Red  Cross  nurse’s  aide  at  a  
hospital. Can I deduct the cost of uniforms that I 
must wear?
Yes,  you  can  deduct  the  cost  of  buying  and 
cleaning   your   uniforms   if   the   hospital   is   a   
qualified  organization,  the  uniforms  are  not 
suitable for everyday use, and you must wear 
them when volunteering.
I pay a babysitter to watch my children while I 
do volunteer  work for a qualified  organization. 
Can I deduct these costs?
No, you cannot deduct payments for child care 
expenses  as  a  charitable  contribution,  even 
if  they  are  necessary  so  you  can  do  volunteer  
work  for  a  qualified  organization.  (If  you  have 
child care expenses so you can work for pay, 
see chapter 31.)
Conventions. If a qualified organization selects you to attend a convention as its representative, you 
can deduct unreimbursed expenses for travel, including a reasonable amount for meals and lodging, 
while away from home overnight in connection with the convention. However, see Travel, later. 
You cannot deduct personal expenses for sightseeing, fishing parties, theater tickets, or nightclubs. You 
also cannot deduct transportation, meals and lodging, and other expenses for your spouse or children. 
You cannot deduct your expenses in attending a church convention if you go only as a member of your 
church rather than as a chosen representative. You can deduct unreimbursed expenses that are directly 
connected with giving services for your church during the convention. 
Uniforms. You can deduct the cost and upkeep of uniforms that are not suitable for everyday use and 
that you must wear while performing donated services for a charitable organization. 
Foster parents. You may be able to deduct as a charitable contribution some of the costs of being a 
foster parent (foster care provider) if you have no profit motive in providing the foster care and are not, in 
fact, making a profit. A qualified organization must designate the individuals you take into your home for 
foster care. 
You can deduct expenses that meet both of the following requirements.  
1. They are unreimbursed out-of-pocket expenses to feed, clothe, and care for the foster 
child. 
2. They are incurred primarily to benefit the qualified organization. 

 359  •  Chapter 25: Contributions
Unreimbursed expenses that you cannot deduct as charitable contributions may be considered support 
provided by you in determining whether you can claim the foster child as a dependent. For details, see 
chapter 3. 
Example
You cared for a foster child because you wanted to adopt her, not to benefit the agency 
that  placed  her  in  your  home.  Your  unreimbursed  expenses  are  not  deductible  as 
charitable contributions. 
Car expenses. You can deduct as a charitable contribution any unreimbursed out-of-pocket expenses, 
such as the cost of gas and oil, that are directly related to the use of your car in giving services to 
a charitable organization. You cannot deduct any part of general repair and maintenance expenses, 
depreciation, registration fees, or the costs of tires or insurance. 
If you do not want to deduct your actual expenses, you can use a standard mileage rate of 14 cents a 
mile to figure your contribution. 
You can deduct parking fees and tolls whether you use your actual expenses or the standard mileage 
rate. 
You must keep reliable written records of your car expenses. For more information, see Car expenses 
under Records to Keep, later. 
Travel. Generally, you can claim a charitable contribution deduction for travel  expenses  necessarily  
incurred while you are away from home performing services for a charitable organization only if there is 
no significant element of personal pleasure, recreation, or vacation in the travel. This applies whether 
you pay the expenses directly or indirectly. You are paying the expenses indirectly if you make a payment 
to the charitable organization and the organization pays for your travel expenses. 
The deduction for travel expenses will not be denied simply because you enjoy providing services to the 
charitable organization. Even if you enjoy the trip, you can take a charitable contribution deduction for 
your travel expenses if you are on duty in a genuine and substantial sense throughout the trip. However, 
if you have only nominal duties, or if for significant parts of the trip you do not have any duties, you 
cannot deduct your travel expenses. 
Example 1
You are a troop leader for a tax-exempt youth group and take the group on a camping 
trip. You are responsible for overseeing the setup of the camp and for providing the 
adult supervision for the other activities during the entire trip. You participate in the 
activities of the group and really enjoy your time with them. You oversee the breaking 
of camp and you transport the group home. You can deduct your travel expenses. 

 360  •  Chapter 25: Contributions
Example 2
You sail from one island to another and spend 8 hours a day counting whales and other 
forms of marine life. The project is sponsored by a charitable organization. In most 
circumstances, you cannot deduct your expenses. 
Example 3
You work for several hours each morning on an archaeological dig sponsored by a 
charitable organization. The rest of the day is free for recreation and sightseeing. You 
cannot take a charitable contribution deduction even though you work very hard during 
those few hours. 
Example 4
You spend the entire day attending a charitable organization’s regional meeting as a 
chosen representative. In the evening you go to the theater. You can claim your travel 
expenses as charitable contributions, but you cannot claim the cost of your evening at 
the theater. 
Daily  allowance  (per  diem). If you provide services for a charitable organization and receive a daily 
allowance to cover reasonable travel expenses, including meals and lodging while away from home 
overnight, you must include in income the amount of the allowance that is more than your deductible 
travel expenses. You may be able to deduct any necessary travel  expenses  that  are  more  than  the  
allowance. 
Deductible travel expenses. These include: 
• Air, rail, and bus transportation, 
• Out-of-pocket expenses for your car, 
• Taxi fares or other costs of transportation between the airport or station and your hotel, 
• Lodging costs, and 
• The cost of meals. 
Because these travel expenses are not business related, they are not subject to the same limits as 
business-related  expenses.  For  information  on  business travel  expenses,  see Travel  Expenses  in  
chapter 20.

 361  •  Chapter 25: Contributions
I V.  CONTRIBUTIONS YOU CANNOT DEDUCT 
There are some contributions that you cannot deduct, such as those made to individuals and those 
made to nonqualified organizations. (See Contributions to Individuals and Contributions to Nonqualified 
Organizations,  next).  There  are  others  that  you  can  deduct  only  part  of,  as  discussed  later  under 
Contributions From Which You Benefit. 
CONTRIBUTIONS TO INDIVIDUALS 
You cannot deduct contributions to specific individuals, including the following. 
• Contributions  to  fraternal  societies  made  for  the  purpose  of  paying  medical  or  burial 
expenses of deceased members.
• Contributions to individuals who are needy or worthy. This includes contributions to a 
qualified organization if you indicate that your contribution is for a specific person. But you 
can deduct a contribution that you give to a qualified organization that in turn helps needy 
or worthy individuals if you do not indicate that your contribution is for a specific person. 
• Payments to a member of the clergy that can be spent as he or she wishes, such as for 
personal expenses. 
• Expenses you paid for another person who provided services to a qualified organization. 
Example
 
Your son does missionary work. You pay his expenses. You cannot claim a deduction 
for your son’s unreimbursed expenses related to his contribution of services. 
• Payments to a hospital that are for services for a specific patient. You cannot deduct these 
payments even if the hospital is operated by a city, a state, or other qualified organization.
CONTRIBUTIONS TO NONQUALIFIED ORGANIZATIONS 
You  cannot  deduct  contributions  to  organizations  that  are  not  qualified  to  receive  tax-deductible 
contributions, including the following.  
1. Certain state bar associations if:  
a) The state bar is not a political subdivision of a state, 
b) The  bar  has  private,  as  well  as  public,  purposes,  such  as  promoting  the 
professional interests of members, and 
c) Your contribution is unrestricted and can be used for private purposes. 
2. Chambers of commerce and other business leagues or organizations. 

 362  •  Chapter 25: Contributions
3. Civic leagues and associations. 
4. Country clubs and other social clubs. 
5. Most foreign organizations. 
6. Homeowners’ associations. 
7. Labor unions. 
8. Political organizations and candidates.  
CONTRIBUTIONS FROM WHICH YOU BENEFIT 
If you receive or expect to receive a financial or economic benefit as a result of making a contribution to 
a qualified organization, you cannot deduct the part of the contribution that represents the value of the 
benefit you receive or expect to receive. These contributions include the following. 
• Contributions to a college or university if the amount paid is to (or for the benefit of) a 
college or university in exchange for tickets (or the right to buy tickets) to an athletic event 
in an athletic stadium of the college or university.
• Contributions from which you receive or expect to receive a credit or deduction against 
state or local taxes unless an exception applies.
• Contributions  for  lobbying.  This  includes  amounts  that  you  earmark  for  use  in,  or  in 
connection with, influencing specific legislation.
• Contributions  to  a  retirement  home  that  are  clearly  for  room,  board,  maintenance, 
or admittance. Also, if the amount of your contribution depends on the type or size of 
apartment you will occupy, it is not a charitable contribution.
• Costs of raffles, bingo, lottery, etc. You cannot deduct as a charitable contribution amounts 
you pay to buy raffle or lottery tickets or to play bingo or other games of chance. For 
information on how to report gambling winnings and losses, see chapter 12 and chapter 
27. 
• Dues to fraternal orders and similar groups. However, see Membership  fees  or  dues, 
earlier, under Contributions You Can Deduct.
• Tuition, or amounts you pay instead of tuition. You also cannot deduct any fixed amount 
you may be required to pay in addition to the tuition to enroll in a private school, even if it 
is designated as a “donation.” 
QUALIFIED CHARITABLE DISTRIBUTIONS
A qualified charitable distribution (QCD) is a distribution made directly by the trustee of your individual 
retirement arrangement (IRA), other than a SEP or SIMPLE IRA, to certain qualified organizations. You 
must have been at least age 70½ when the distribution was made. Your total QCDs for the year cannot 
be more than $100,000. If all the requirements are met, a QCD is nontaxable, but you cannot claim a 
charitable contribution deduction for a QCD.

 363  •  Chapter 25: Contributions
Qualified charitable distribution one-time election. Beginning in 2023, you can elect to make a one-
time distribution up to $50,000 from an individual retirement account to charities through a charitable 
remainder annuity trust, a charitable remainder unitrust, or a charitable gift annuity, each of which is 
funded only by qualified charitable distributions.
VALUE OF TIME OR SERVICES 
You cannot deduct the value of your time or services, including: 
• Blood donations to the American Red Cross or to blood banks, and 
• The value of income lost while you work as an unpaid volunteer for a qualified organization. 
PERSONAL EXPENSES 
You cannot deduct personal, living, or family expenses, such as: 
• The cost of meals you eat while you perform services for a qualified organization unless 
it is necessary for you to be away from home overnight while performing the services, or 
• Adoption expenses, including fees paid to an adoption agency and the costs of keeping a 
child in your home before adoption is final (but see Adoption Credit in chapter 37 and the 
instructions for Form 8839, Qualified Adoption Expenses).  
V.   CONTRIBUTIONS OF PROPERTY 
If  you  contribute  property  to  a  qualified  organization,  the  amount  of  your charitable  contribution  is 
generally the fair market value of the property at the time of the contribution. However, if the property 
has increased in value, you may have to make some adjustments to the amount of your deduction. See 
Giving Property That Has Increased in Value, later. 
For information about the records you must keep and the information you must furnish with your return if 
you donate property, see Records To Keep and How To Report, later. 
Clothing  and  household  items. You  cannot  take  a  deduction  for  clothing  or  household  items  you 
donate, unless the clothing or household items are in good used condition or better.
Exception
You can take a deduction for a contribution of an item of clothing or household item 
that is not in good used condition or better if you deduct more than $500 for it and 
include a qualified appraisal of it with your return.

 364  •  Chapter 25: Contributions
Household items. Household items include:
• Furniture,
• Furnishings,
• Electronics,
• Appliances,
• Linens, and
• Other similar items.
Household items do not include:
• Food,
• Paintings, antiques, and other objects of art,
• Jewelry and gems, and
• Collections.
Cars, boats, and airplanes. The following rules apply to any donation of a qualified vehicle. 
A qualified vehicle is:
• A car or any motor vehicle manufactured mainly for use on public streets, roads, and 
highways,
• A boat, or
• An airplane.
Deduction more than $500. If you donate a qualified vehicle to a qualified organization and you claim a 
deduction of more than $500, you can deduct the smaller of:
• The gross proceeds from the sale of the vehicle by the organization, or
• The vehicle’s fair market value on the date of the contribution. If the vehicle’s fair market 
value was more than your cost or other basis, you may have to reduce the fair market 
value  to  get  the  deductible  amount,  as  described  under Giving  Property  That  Has  
Increased in Value, later.
Form  1098-C.  You must attach to your return the copy of the Form 1098-C, Contributions  of  Motor  
Vehicles, Boats, and Airplanes, (or other statement containing the same information as Form 1098-C) 
you received from the organization. The Form 1098-C (or other statement) will show the gross proceeds 
from the sale of the vehicle.

 365  •  Chapter 25: Contributions
If you e-file your return, you must: (a) attach Copy B of Form 1098-C to Form 8453 and mail the forms to 
the IRS, or (b) include Copy B of Form 1098-C as a PDF attachment if your software program allows it.
If you do not attach Form 1098-C (or other statement), you cannot deduct your contribution. You must 
get Form 1098-C (or other statement) within 30 days of the sale of the vehicle. But if exception 1 or 2 
(described next) applies, you must get Form 1098-C (or other statement) within 30 days of your donation.
Exceptions. There are two exceptions to the rules just described for deductions of more than $500.
Exception 1
Vehicle   used   or   improved   by   organization.  If  the  qualified  organization 
makes a significant intervening use of or material improvement to the vehicle before 
transferring it, you generally can deduct the vehicle’s fair market value at the time of 
the contribution. But if the vehicle’s fair market value was more than your cost or other 
basis, you may have to reduce the fair market value to get the deductible amount, as 
described under Giving Property That Has Increased in Value, later. The Form 1098-C 
(or other statement) will show whether this exception applies.
Exception 2
Vehicle given or sold to needy individual. If the qualified organization will give 
the vehicle, or sell it for a price well below fair market value, to a needy individual to 
further the organization’s charitable purpose, you generally can deduct the vehicle’s 
fair market value at the time of the contribution. But if the vehicle’s fair market value 
was more than your cost or other basis, you may have to reduce the fair market value 
to get the deductible amount, as described under Giving Property That Has Increased 
in Value, later. The Form 1098-C (or other statement) will show whether this exception 
applies.
This exception does not apply if the organization sells the vehicle at auction. In that 
case, you cannot deduct the vehicle’s fair market value.
Example
Anita donates a used car to a qualified organization. She bought it 3 years ago for 
$9,000. A used car guide shows the fair market value for this type of car is $6,000. 
However, Anita gets a Form 1098-C from the organization showing the car was sold for 
$2,900. Neither exception 1 nor exception 2 applies. If Anita itemizes her deductions, 
she can deduct $2,900 for her donation. She must attach the Form 1098-C and Form 
8283 to her return.

 366  •  Chapter 25: Contributions
Deduction $500 or less. If the qualified organization sells the vehicle for $500 or less and exceptions 1 
and 2 do not apply, you can deduct the smaller of:
• $500, or
• The vehicle’s fair market value on the date of the contribution. But if the vehicle’s fair 
market value was more than your cost or other basis, you may have to reduce the fair 
market value to get the deductible amount, as described under Giving Property That Has 
Increased in Value, later.
If the vehicle’s fair market value is at least $250 but not more than $500, you must have a written 
statement from the qualified organization acknowledging your donation. The statement must contain the 
information and meet the tests for an acknowledgment described under Deductions of At Least $250 But 
Not More Than $500 under Records to Keep, later.
DETERMINING FAIR MARKET VALUE 
This  section  discusses  general  guidelines  for  determining  the  fair  market  value  of  various  types  of 
donated property. Fair market value is the price at which property would change hands between a willing 
buyer and a willing seller, neither having to buy or sell, and both having reasonable knowledge of all the 
relevant facts. 
Used clothing and household items. Generally, the fair market value of used clothing and household 
goods is far less than what you paid for them when they were new.
For used clothing, you should claim as the value the price that buyers of used items actually pay in used 
clothing stores, such as consignment or thrift shops. 
Example
Dawn Greene donated a coat to a thrift store operated by her church. She paid $300 for 
the coat 3 years ago. Similar coats in the thrift store sell for $50. The fair market value 
of the coat is reasonably determined to be $50. Dawn’s donation is limited to $50. 
Cars,  boats,  and  airplane. If you contribute a car, boat, or airplane to a charitable organization, you 
must determine its fair market value. 
Certain  commercial  firms  and  trade  organizations  publish  guides,  commonly  called  “blue  books,” 
containing complete dealer sale prices or dealer average prices for recent model years. The guides may 
be published monthly or seasonally and for different regions of the country. These guides also provide 
estimates for adjusting for unusual equipment, unusual mileage, and physical condition. The prices are 
not “official” and these publications are not considered an appraisal of any specific donated property. But 
they do provide clues for making an appraisal and suggest relative prices for comparison with current 
sales and offerings in your area. 

 367  •  Chapter 25: Contributions
Large  quantities. If you contribute a large number of the same item, fair market value is the price at 
which comparable numbers of the item are being sold. 
GIVING PROPERTY THAT HAS DECREASED IN VALUE 
If you contribute property with a fair market value that is less than your basis in it, your deduction is 
limited to its fair market value. You cannot claim a deduction for the difference between the property’s 
basis and its fair market value. 
GIVING PROPERTY THAT HAS INCREASED IN VALUE 
If you contribute property with a fair market value that is more than your basis in it, you may have to 
reduce the fair market value by the amount of appreciation (increase in value) when you figure your 
deduction. 
Your basis in property is generally what you paid for it. See chapter 13 if you need more information 
about basis. 
Different rules apply to figuring your deduction, depending on whether the property is:  
1. Ordinary income property, or 
2. Capital gain property.  
Ordinary income property. Property is ordinary income property if you would have recognized ordinary 
income or short-term capital gain had you sold it at fair market value on the date it was contributed. 
Examples of ordinary income property are inventory, works of art created by the donor, manuscripts 
prepared by the donor, and capital assets held 1 year or less. 
Amount of deduction. The amount you can deduct for a contribution of ordinary income property is its 
fair market value minus the amount that would be ordinary income or short-term capital gain if you sold 
the property for its fair market value. Generally, this rule limits the deduction to your basis in the property. 
Example
You donate stock that you held for 5 months to your church. The fair market value of the 
stock on the day you donate it is $1,000, but you paid only $800 (your basis). Because 
the $200 of appreciation would be short-term capital gain if you sold the stock, your 
deduction is limited to $800 (fair market value less the appreciation). 
Capital gain property. Property is capital gain property if it would have resulted in long-term capital gain 
had you sold it at fair market value on the date of the contribution. It includes capital assets held more 
than 1 year, as well as certain real property and depreciable property used in your trade or business and, 
generally, held more than 1 year. 

 368  •  Chapter 25: Contributions
Amount of deduction – general rule. When figuring your deduction for a contribution of capital gain 
property, you usually can use the fair market value of the property. 
Exception
In certain situations, you must reduce the fair market value by any amount that would 
have been long-term capital gain if you had sold the property for its fair market value. 
Generally, this means reducing the fair market value to the property’s cost or other 
basis.
Bargain sales. A bargain sale of property is a sale or exchange for less than the property’s fair market 
value. A bargain sale to a qualified organization is partly a charitable contribution and partly a sale or 
exchange. A bargain sale may result in a taxable gain.
VI. WHEN TO DEDUCT 
You can deduct your contributions only in the year you actually make them in cash or other property (or 
in a later carryover year, as explained later under Carryovers). This applies whether you use the cash or 
an accrual method of accounting. 
Time of making contribution. Usually, you make a contribution at the time of its unconditional delivery. 
Checks. A check that you mail to a charity is considered delivered on the date you mail it.
Text  message.  Contributions  made  by  text  message  are  deductible  in  the  year  you  send  the  text 
message if the contribution is charged to your telephone or wireless account. 
Credit  card.  Contributions charged on your bank credit card are deductible in the year you make the 
charge. 
Pay-by-phone account. Contributions made through a pay-by-phone account are considered delivered 
on the date the financial institution pays the amount. 
Stock certificate. A properly endorsed stock certificate is considered completed on the date of mailing or 
other delivery to the charity or to the charity’s agent. However, if you give a stock certificate to your agent 
or to the issuing corporation for transfer to the name of the charity, your contribution is not delivered until 
the date the stock is transferred on the books of the corporation. 
Promissory  note.  If  you  issue  and  deliver  a  promissory  note  to  a  charitable  organization  as  a 
contribution, it is not a contribution until you make the note payments. 
Option. If you grant a charity an option to buy real property at a bargain price, it is not a contribution until 
the organization exercises the option. 
Borrowed  funds. If you contribute borrowed funds, you can deduct the contribution in the year you 
deliver the funds to the charity, regardless of when you repay the loan.

 369  •  Chapter 25: Contributions
VII. LIMITS ON DEDUCTIONS 
Generally, the amount you can deduct for charitable contributions cannot be more than 60% of your 
adjusted gross income (AGI). Your deduction may be further limited to 50%, 30%, or 20% of your AGI, 
depending on the type of property you give and the type of organization you give it to.
For 2024, your deduction for cash contributions is limited to 60% of your AGI minus your deductions for 
all other contributions.
CARRYOVERS 
You can carry over your contributions that you cannot deduct in the current year because they exceed 
your adjusted-gross-income limits. Except for qualified conservation contributions, you can deduct the 
excess in each of the next 5 years until it is used up, but not beyond that time. 
VIII. RECORDS TO KEEP 
You must keep records to prove the amount of the contributions you make during the year. The kind of 
records you must keep depends on the amount of your contributions and whether they are:
• Cash contributions,
• Noncash contributions, or
• Out-of-pocket expenses when donating your services.
Note
An organization generally must give you a written statement if it receives a payment 
from you that is more than $75 and is partly a contribution and partly for goods or 
services. See Contributions From Which You Benefit under Contributions  You  Can  
Deduct, earlier). Keep the statement for your records. It may satisfy all or part of the 
recordkeeping and requirements explained in the following discussions.
CASH CONTRIBUTIONS 
Cash contributions include those paid by cash, check, electronic funds transfer, online payment service, 
credit card, payroll deduction, or transfer of a gift card redeemable for cash. 
You cannot deduct a cash contribution, regardless of the amount, unless you keep one of the following.
1. A  bank  record  that  shows  the  name  of  the  qualified  organization,  the  date  of  the 
contribution, and the amount of the contribution. Bank records may include:
a) A canceled check,
b) A bank or credit union statement, 

 370  •  Chapter 25: Contributions
c) A credit card statement,
d) An electronic fund transfer receipt, or
e) A scanned image of both sides of a canceled check obtained from a bank or 
credit union website.
2. A  receipt  (or  letter  or  other  written  communication)  from  the  qualified  organization 
showing the name of the organization, the date of the contribution, and the amount of the 
contribution.
3. The payroll deduction records described next.
Payroll deductions. If you can make a contribution by payroll deduction, you must keep:
1. A pay stub, Form W-2, or other document furnished by your employer that shows the date 
and amount of the contribution, and
2. A pledge or other document prepared by you for the qualified organization that shows the 
name of the organization and states the organization does not provide goods or services 
in return for any contribution made to it by payroll deduction.
If your employer withheld $250 or more from a single paycheck, see Contributions of $250 or More, next.
Contributions of $250 or More 
You can claim a deduction for a contribution of $250 or more only if you have a contemporaneous written  
acknowledgment of your contribution from the qualified organization or certain payroll deduction records. 
If you made more than one contribution of $250 or more, you must have either a separate acknowledgment 
for each or one acknowledgment that lists each contribution and the date of each contribution and shows 
your total contributions.
Amount of contribution. In figuring whether your contribution is $250 or more, do not combine separate 
contributions. For example, if you gave your church $25 each week, your weekly payments do not have 
to be combined. Each payment is a separate contribution.
If  contributions  are  made  by  payroll  deduction,  the  deduction  from  each  paycheck  is  treated  as  a 
separate contribution.
If you made a payment that is partly for goods and services, as described earlier under Contributions 
From Which You Benefit, your contribution is the amount of the payment that is more than the value of 
the goods and services. 
Acknowledgment. The acknowledgment must meet these tests.  
1. It must be written. 
2. It must include:  
a) The amount of cash you contributed, 

 371  •  Chapter 25: Contributions
b) Whether  the  qualified  organization  gave  you  any  goods  or  services  as  a 
result of your contribution (other than certain token items and membership 
benefits), and
c) A description and good faith estimate of the value of any goods or services 
described in (b). If the only benefit you received was an intangible religious 
benefit  (such  as  admission  to  a  religious  ceremony)  that  generally  is 
not  sold  in  a  commercial  transaction  outside  the  donative  context,  the 
acknowledgment must say so and does not need to describe or estimate the 
value of the benefit. 
3. You must get it on or before the earlier of:  
a) The date you file your return for the year you make the contribution, or 
b) The due date, including extensions, for filing the return.  
If the acknowledgment does not show the date of the contribution, you must also have a bank record or 
receipt, as described earlier, that does show the date of the contribution. If the acknowledgment does 
show the date of the contribution and meets the other tests just described, you do not need any other 
records.
Contemporaneous    written    acknowledgment    (CWA).    Organizations    typically    send    written    
acknowledgments to donors no later than January 31 of the year following the donation. For the written 
acknowledgment to be considered contemporaneous with the contribution, it must meet both of the 
following requirements:
1. Meet all the tests described under Acknowledgment, earlier, and
2. You must get it on or before the earlier of:
a) The date you file your return for the year you make the contribution, or
b) The due date, including extensions, for filing the return.
Payroll deductions. If you make a contribution by payroll deduction and your employer withheld $250 
or more from a single paycheck, you must keep:  
1. A pay stub, Form W-2, or other document furnished by your employer that shows the 
amount withheld as a contribution, and 
2. A pledge card or other document prepared by or for the qualified organization that shows 
the  name  of  the  organization  and  states  the  organization  does  not  provide  goods  or  
services in return for any contribution made to it by payroll deduction.  
A single pledge card may be kept for all contributions made by payroll deduction regardless of amount 
as long as it contains all the required information.
If the pay stub, Form W-2, pledge card, or other document does not show the date of the contribution, 
you must also have another document that does show the date of the contribution. If the pay stub, Form 

 372  •  Chapter 25: Contributions
W-2, pledge card, or other document does show the date of the contribution, you do not need any other 
records except those just described in (1) and (2).
NONCASH CONTRIBUTIONS 
For a contribution not made in cash, the records you must keep depend on whether your deduction for 
the contribution is:  
1. Less than $250, 
2. At least $250 but not more than $500, 
3. Over $500 but not more than $5,000, or
4. Over $5,000. 
Amount  of  deduction.  In  figuring  whether  your  deduction  is  $500  or  more,  combine  your  claimed 
deductions for all similar items of property donated to any charitable organization during the year. If 
you received goods or services in return, as described earlier in Contributions From Which You Benefit, 
reduce your contribution by the value of those goods or services. If you figure your deduction by reducing 
the fair market value of the donated property by its appreciation, as described earlier in Giving Property 
That Has Increased in Value, your contribution is the reduced amount. 
Deductions of Less Than $250 
If you make any noncash contribution, you must get and keep a receipt from the charitable organization 
showing:  
1. The name and address of the charitable organization, 
2. The date and location of the charitable contribution, and 
3. A reasonably detailed description of the property.
4. For a security, the name of the issuer, the type of security, and whether it is publicly 
traded as of the date of the contribution. For example, a security is generally considered 
to be publicly traded if the security is (a) listed on a recognized stock exchange whose 
quotations are published daily, (b) regularly traded on a national or regional over-the-
counter market, or (c) quoted daily in a national newspaper of general circulation in the 
case of mutual fund shares.
A letter or other written communication from the charitable organization acknowledging receipt of the 
contribution and containing the information in (1), (2), (3), and (4) will serve as a receipt.
You are not required to have a receipt where it is impractical to get one (for example, if you leave 
property at a charity’s unattended drop site). 
Additional records. You must also keep reliable written records for each item of donated property. Your 
written records must include the following information.  

 373  •  Chapter 25: Contributions
1. The information in (1), (2), (3), and (4) above. 
2. If you claim a deduction for clothing or a household item, a description of the condition of 
the clothing or item.
3. The fair market value of the property at the time of the contribution and how you figured the 
fair market value. If it was determined by appraisal, keep a signed copy of the appraisal.
Deductions of at Least $250 but Not More Than $500 
If you claim a deduction of at least $250 but not more than $500 for a noncash charitable contribution, 
you  must  get  and  keep  a  contemporaneous  written  acknowledgment  of  your  contribution  from  the 
qualified organization. If you made more than one contribution of $250 or more, you must have either a 
separate acknowledgment for each or one acknowledgment that shows your total contributions. 
The acknowledgment must contain the information in items (1) through (3) listed under Deductions  of  
Less Than $250, earlier, and your written records must include the information listed in that discussion 
under Additional records. 
The acknowledgment must also meet these tests.  
1. It must be written. 
2. It must include:  
a) A description (but not necessarily the value) of any property you contributed,
b) Whether  the  qualified  organization  gave  you  any  goods  or  services  as  a 
result of your contribution (other than certain token items and membership 
benefits), and 
c) A description and good faith estimate of the value of any goods or services 
described in (b). If the only benefit you received was an intangible religious 
benefit  (such  as  admission  to  a  religious  ceremony)  that  generally  is 
not  sold  in  a  commercial  transaction  outside  the  donative  context,  the 
acknowledgment must say so and does not need to describe or estimate the 
value of the benefit. 
3. You must get it on or before the earlier of:  
a) The date you file your return for the year you make the contribution, or 
b) The due date, including extensions, for filing the return.  
Deductions Over $500 but Not Over $5,000
If you claim a deduction over $500 but not over $5,000 for a noncash charitable contribution, you must 
complete Form 8283 and have the CWA, earlier. Your completed Form 8283 must include:
1. Your name and taxpayer identification number,
2. The name and address of the qualified organization,

 374  •  Chapter 25: Contributions
3. The date of the charitable contribution, and
4. The following information about the contributed property:
a) A  description  of  the  property  in  sufficient  detail  under  the  circumstances 
(taking  into  account  the  value  of  the  property)  for  a  person  not  generally 
familiar with the type of property to understand that the description is of the 
contributed property;
b) The FMV of the property on the contribution date and the method used in 
figuring the FMV;
c) In the case of real or tangible property, its condition;
d) In the case of tangible personal property, whether the donee has certified it 
for a use related to the purpose or function constituting the donee’s basis for 
exemption under Section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code or, in the case of 
a governmental unit, an exclusively public purpose;
e) In the case of securities, the name of the issuer, the type of securities, and 
whether they were publicly traded as of the date of the contribution;
f) How you got the property, for example, by purchase, gift, bequest, inheritance, 
or exchange;
g) The  approximate  date  you  got  the  property  or,  if  created,  produced, 
or  manufactured  by  or  for  you,  the  approximate  date  the  property  was 
substantially completed; and
h) The cost or other basis, and any adjustments to the basis, of property held 
less than 12 months and, if available, the cost or other basis of property held 
12  months  or  more. This  requirement,  however,  doesn’t  apply  to  publicly 
traded securities.
Deductions Over $5,000
If you claim a deduction of over $5,000 for a noncash charitable contribution, you must have the CWA, 
earlier,  obtain  a  qualified  written  appraisal  of  the  donated  property  from  a  qualified  appraiser,  and 
complete Form 8283. A qualified appraisal is not required for contributions of qualified vehicles for which 
you obtain a CWA, certain inventory, publicly traded securities, or certain intellectual property. 
In addition to, or in lieu of, the items described in Deductions Over $500 but Not Over $5,000 earlier, 
your completed Form 8283 must include:
1. The qualified organization’s taxpayer identification number, signature, the date signed by 
the qualified organization, and the date the qualified organization received the property;
2. The  appraiser’s  name,  address,  taxpayer  identification  number,  appraiser  declaration, 
signature, and the date signed by the appraiser; and
3. The following additional information about the contributed property:

 375  •  Chapter 25: Contributions
a) The FMV on the valuation effective date; and
b) A  statement  explaining  whether  the  charitable  contribution  was  made  by 
means of a bargain sale and, if so, the amount of any consideration received 
for the contribution.
OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES
If  you  give  services  to  a  qualified  organization  and  have  unreimbursed  out-of-pocket  expenses, 
considered separately, of $250 or more, related to those services, the following two rules apply.
1. You must have adequate records to prove the amount of the expenses.
2. You must get an acknowledgment from the qualified organization that contains:
a) A description of the services you provided,
b) A  statement  of  whether  or  not  the  organization  provided  you  any  goods  or  
services to reimburse you for the expenses you incurred,
c) A description and a good faith estimate of the value of any goods or services 
(other than intangible religious benefits) provided to reimburse you, and
d) A statement that the only benefit you received was an intangible religious 
benefit, if that was the case. The acknowledgment does not need to describe 
or estimate the value of an intangible religious benefit (defined earlier under 
Acknowledgment).
You must get the acknowledgment on or before the earlier of:
1. The date you file your return for the year you make the contribution, or
2. The due date, including extensions, for filing the return.
Car expenses. If you claim expenses directly related to use of your car in giving services to a qualified 
organization,  you  must  keep  reliable  written  records  of  your  expenses.  Whether  your  records  are 
considered reliable depends on all the facts and circumstances. Generally, they may be considered 
reliable if you made them regularly and at or near the time you had the expenses.
For example, your records might show the name of the organization you were serving and the date 
each time you used your car for a charitable purpose. If you use the standard mileage rate of 14 cents 
a mile, your records must show the miles you drove your car for the charitable purpose. If you deduct 
your actual expenses, your records must show the costs of operating the car that are directly related to 
a charitable purpose.
See Car expenses under Out-of-Pocket Expenses in Giving Services, earlier, for the expenses you can 
deduct.
IX. HOW TO REPORT 
Report  your  charitable  contributions  on  Schedule A  (Form  1040),  lines  11  through  14.  If  you  made 
noncash contributions for the year is over $500, you may also be required to fill out parts of Form 8283.

CHAPTER 26: NONBUSINESS CASUALTY 
AND THEFT LOSSES
Chapter Objective
After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• Recall the tax treatment of personal casualty and theft losses.
I.   WHAT’S NEW/REMINDERS
Limitation on personal casualty and theft losses. As a result of the TCJA, personal casualty and theft 
losses of an individual, sustained in a tax year beginning after 2017, are deductible only to the extent that 
the losses are attributable to a federally declared disaster. Personal casualty and theft losses attributable 
to a federally declared disaster are subject to the $100 per casualty and 10% of your adjusted gross 
income (AGI) limitations unless they are attributable to a qualified disaster loss. Personal casualty and 
theft losses attributable to a qualified disaster loss are not subject to the 10% of AGI tax reduction, and 
the $100 reduction is increased to $500.
An  exception  to  the  rule  above,  limiting  the  personal  casualty  and  theft  loss  deduction  to  losses 
attributable to a federally declared disaster, applies if you have personal casualty gains for the tax year. 
Special rules for capital gains invested in qualified opportunity funds (QOFs). If you have a capital 
gain for 2024, you can invest that gain into a qualified opportunity fund (QOF) and elect to defer part or 
all of the gain that you would otherwise include in income until December 31, 2026. You may also be 
able to permanently exclude gain from the sale or exchange of an investment in a QOF if the investment 
is held for at least 10 years. For information about how to elect to use these special rules, see the 
Instructions for Form 8949, Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets. For additional information, 
see Opportunity Zones Frequently Asked Questions on IRS.gov.
Deferral of gain invested in a QOF. If you realize a gain from an actual, or deemed, sale or exchange 
with an unrelated person and during the 180-day period beginning on the date realizing the gain, invested 
an amount of the gain in a QOF, you may be able to elect to temporarily defer part or all of the gain that 
would otherwise be included in income. If you make the election, the gain is included in taxable income 
only to the extent, if any, that the amount of realized gain exceeds the aggregate amount invested in a 
QOF during the 180-day period beginning on the date the gain was realized.
How to report. Report the gain as it would otherwise be reported if you were not making the election. 
Report the election for the amount invested in a QOF on Form 8949. See the Instructions for Form 
8949 for information on how to make the election. You will need to attach Form 8997 annually until you 
dispose of the QOF investment. See the Form 8997 instructions for more information.

 379  •  Chapter 26: Nonbusiness Casualty and Theft Losses
QOF investment. If you held a qualified investment in a QOF at any time during the year, you must file 
your return with Form 8997 attached. See the Form 8997 instructions.
II. INTRODUCTION 
This chapter explains the tax treatment of personal (not business related) casualty losses, theft losses, 
and losses on deposits.
The chapter also explains the following topics: 
• How to figure the amount of your loss. 
• How to treat insurance and other reimbursements you receive. 
• The deduction limits. 
• When and how to report a casualty or theft.
• The special rules for disaster area losses. 
Forms to file. When you have a casualty or theft, you have to file Form 4684. You will also have to file 
one or more of the following forms:
• Schedule A (Form 1040).
• Schedule A (Form 1040-NR) (for nonresident aliens).
• Schedule D (Form 1040).
• Form 4797.
III. CA SUA LT Y 
A casualty is the damage, destruction, or loss of property resulting from an identifiable event that is 
sudden, unexpected, or unusual: 
• A sudden event is one that is swift, not gradual or progressive. 
• An unexpected event is one that is ordinarily unanticipated and unintended.
• An unusual event is one that is not a day-to-day occurrence and that is not typical of the 
activity in which you were engaged.
Casualty losses are deductible during the tax year that the loss is sustained. This is generally the tax 
year that the loss occurred. However, a casualty loss may be sustained in a year after the casualty 
occurred. See When To Report Gains and Losses, later.
Definitions. Three types of casualty losses are mentioned in this chapter:
1. Federal casualty losses,

 380  •  Chapter 26: Nonbusiness Casualty and Theft Losses
2. Disaster losses, and
3. Qualified disaster losses.
All three types of losses refer to federally declared disasters, but the requirements for each loss vary. 
A federally declared disaster is a disaster determined by the President of the United States to warrant 
assistance by the federal government under the Stafford Act. A federally declared disaster includes (a) a 
major disaster declaration or (b) an emergency declaration under the Stafford Act.
Federal casualty loss. A federal casualty loss is an individual’s casualty or theft loss of personal-use 
property that is attributable to a federally declared disaster. The casualty loss must occur in a state 
receiving a federal disaster declaration. If you suffered a federal casualty loss, you are eligible to claim 
a casualty loss deduction. If you suffered a casualty or theft loss of personal-use property that was 
not attributable to federally declared disaster, it is not a federal casualty loss, and you may not claim a 
casualty loss deduction unless the exception applies. See the Caution under Deductible losses, later.
Disaster loss. A disaster loss is a loss that is attributable to a federally declared disaster and that occurs 
in an area eligible for assistance pursuant to the Presidential declaration. The disaster loss must occur in 
a county eligible for public or individual assistance (or both). Disaster losses are not limited to individual 
personal-use property and may be claimed for individual business or income-producing property and by 
corporations, S corporations, and partnerships. If you suffered a disaster loss, you are eligible to claim a 
casualty loss deduction and to elect to claim the loss in the preceding tax year. See Disaster Area Loss, 
later.
Qualified disaster loss. A qualified disaster loss is an individual’s casualty or theft loss of personal-use 
property that is attributable to a major disaster declared by the President. 
If you suffered a qualified disaster loss, you are eligible to claim a casualty loss deduction, to elect to 
claim the loss in the preceding tax year, and to deduct the loss without itemizing other deductions on 
Schedule A (Form 1040). 
Deductible losses. For tax years 2018 through 2025, if you are an individual, casualty losses of personal-
use property are deductible only if the loss is attributable to a federally declared disaster (federal casualty 
loss). If the event causing you to suffer a personal casualty loss occurred before January 1, 2018, but 
the casualty loss was not sustained until January 1, 2018, or later, the casualty loss is not deductible. 
See When To Report Gains and Losses, later, for more information on when a casualty loss is sustained.
Caution!
An exception to the rule limiting the deduction for personal casualty and theft losses 
to federal casualty losses applies where you have personal casualty gains. In this case, 
you may deduct personal casualty losses that are not attributable to a federally declared 
disaster to the extent they do not exceed your personal casualty gains.

 381  •  Chapter 26: Nonbusiness Casualty and Theft Losses
Casualty losses can result from a number of different causes, including the following:
• Car accidents (but see Nondeductible losses next for exceptions).
• Earthquakes.
• Fires (but see Nondeductible losses next for exceptions).
• Floods.
• Government-ordered demolition or relocation of a home that is unsafe to use because of 
a disaster.
• Mine cave-ins.
• Shipwrecks.
• Sonic booms.
• Storms, including hurricanes and tornadoes.
• Terrorist attacks.
• Vandalism.
• Volcanic eruptions.
Nondeductible losses. A casualty loss is not deductible, even to the extent the loss does not exceed 
your personal casualty gains, if the damage or destruction is caused by the following:
• Accidentally breaking articles, such as glassware or china under normal conditions.
• A family pet (explained below).
• A fire if you willfully set it or pay someone else to set it.
• A  car  accident  if  your  willful  negligence  or  willful  act  caused  it.  The  same  is  true  if  the  
willful act or willful negligence of someone acting for you caused the accident.
• Progressive deterioration (explained later).
Family pet. Loss of property due to damage by a family pet is not deductible as a casualty loss unless 
the requirements discussed earlier under Casualty are met.
Example
Your antique oriental rug was damaged by your new puppy before it was housebroken. 
Because the damage was not unexpected and unusual, the loss is not deductible as a 
casualty loss.

 382  •  Chapter 26: Nonbusiness Casualty and Theft Losses
Progressive  deterioration. Loss of property due to progressive deterioration is not deductible as a 
casualty loss. This is because the damage results from a steadily operating cause or a normal process, 
rather than from a sudden event. The following are examples of damage due to progressive deterioration:
• The steady weakening of a building due to normal wind and weather conditions.
• The deterioration and damage to a water heater that bursts. However, the rust and water 
damage to rugs and drapes caused by the bursting of a water heater does qualify as a 
casualty.
• Most losses of property caused by droughts. To be deductible, a drought-related loss 
generally must be incurred in a trade or business or in a transaction entered into for profit.
• Termite or moth damage.
• The damage or destruction of trees, shrubs, or other plants by a fungus, disease, insects, 
worms, or similar pests. However, a sudden destruction due to an unexpected or unusual 
infestation of beetles or other insects may result in a casualty loss.
I V.  THEFT
A theft is the taking and removing of money or property with the intent to deprive the owner of it. The 
taking of property must be illegal under the laws of the state where it occurred and it must have been 
done with criminal intent. You do not need to show a conviction for theft.
Theft includes the taking of money or property by the following means:
• Blackmail.
• Burglary.
• Embezzlement.
• Extortion.
• Kidnapping for ransom.
• Larceny.
• Robbery.
The taking of money or property through fraud or misrepresentation is theft if it is illegal under state or 
local law.
Theft loss deduction limited. For tax years 2018 through 2025, if you are an individual, casualty and 
theft losses of personal-use property are deductible only if the losses are attributable to a federally 
declared disaster (federal casualty loss).

 383  •  Chapter 26: Nonbusiness Casualty and Theft Losses
Caution!
An exception to the rule limiting the deduction for personal casualty and theft losses 
to federal casualty losses applies where you have personal casualty gains. In this case, 
you may deduct personal casualty losses that are not attributable to a federally declared 
disaster to the extent they do not exceed your personal casualty gains.
Example
Martin and Grace experienced multiple personal casualties in 2024. Grace’s diamond 
necklace was stolen, resulting in a $15,500 casualty loss. Martin and Grace also lost their 
camper as a result of a lightning strike. They have replacement-value insurance on the 
camper, so they have a $13,000 gain. Finally, they lost their car in a flood determined to 
be a federally declared disaster, resulting in a casualty loss of $25,000. Because Martin 
and Grace experienced a $13,000 personal casualty gain as a result of the replacement-
value insurance, they can offset that gain with a portion of their loss attributable to the 
stolen necklace and claim the full federal casualty loss of $25,000 subject to the 10% of 
AGI and $100 limitations.
Decline  in  market  value  of  stock. You cannot deduct as a theft loss the decline in market value of 
stock acquired on the open market for investment if the decline is caused by disclosure of accounting 
fraud or other illegal misconduct by the officers or directors of the corporation that issued the stock. 
However, you may be able to deduct it as a capital loss on Schedule D (Form 1040) if the stock is sold or 
exchanged or becomes completely worthless. 
Mislaid or lost property. The simple disappearance of money or property is not a theft. However, an 
accidental loss or disappearance of property can qualify as a casualty if it results from an identifiable 
event that is sudden, unexpected, or unusual. Sudden, unexpected, and unusual events are defined 
earlier.
Example
A car door is accidentally slammed on your hand, breaking the setting of your diamond 
ring. The diamond falls from the ring and is never found. The loss of the diamond is a 
casualty.
Losses from Ponzi-type investment schemes. If you had a loss from a Ponzi-type investment scheme, 
see the following:
• Revenue Ruling 2009-9, 2009-14 I.R.B. 735.
• Revenue Procedure 2009-20, 2009-14 I.R.B. 749.

 384  •  Chapter 26: Nonbusiness Casualty and Theft Losses
• Revenue Procedure 2011-58, 2011-50 I.R.B. 849.
If you qualify to use Revenue Procedure 2009-20, as modified by Revenue Procedure 2011-58, and 
you choose to follow the procedures in the guidance, first fill out Section C of Form 4684 to determine 
the amount to enter on Section B, line 28. Skip lines 19 through 27. Section C of Form 4684 replaces 
Appendix  A  in  Revenue  Procedure  2009-20.  You  do  not  need  to  complete  Appendix  A.  For  more 
information, see the above revenue ruling and revenue procedures, and the Instructions for Form 4684.
If  you  choose  not  to  use  the  procedures  in  Revenue  Procedure  2009-20,  as  modified  by  Revenue 
Procedure  2011-58,  you  may  claim  your  theft  loss  by  filling  out  Section  B,  lines  19  through  39,  as 
appropriate.
V.   LOSS ON DEPOSITS
A loss on deposits can occur when a bank, credit union, or other financial institution becomes insolvent 
or bankrupt. If you incurred this type of loss, you can choose one of the following ways to deduct the 
loss:
• As a casualty loss (to the extent the loss does not exceed your personal casualty gains).
• As a nonbusiness bad debt.
Caution!
 
You can no longer claim any miscellaneous itemized deductions, including the deduction 
for an ordinary loss on deposits in insolvent or bankrupt financial institutions.
Casualty loss. You can choose to deduct a loss on deposits as a casualty loss for any year in which you 
can reasonably estimate how much of your deposits you have lost in an insolvent or bankrupt financial 
institution. The choice is generally made on the return you file for that year and applies to all your losses 
on deposits for the year in that particular financial institution. If you treat the loss as a casualty loss, 
you cannot treat the same amount of the loss as a nonbusiness bad debt when it actually becomes 
worthless. However, you can take a nonbusiness bad debt deduction for any amount of loss that is more 
than the estimated amount you deducted as a casualty or ordinary loss. Once you make this choice, you 
cannot change it without permission from the IRS.
Casualty  loss  limitation.  If  you  are  an  individual,  casualty  losses  of  personal-use  property  are 
deductible only if the loss is attributable to a federally declared disaster. An exception to the rule limiting 
the deduction for personal casualty and theft losses to federal casualty losses applies where you have 
personal casualty gains. Because a loss on deposits is not attributable to a federally declared disaster, 
you may deduct losses on deposits as personal casualty losses only to the extent they do not exceed 
your personal casualty gains.

 385  •  Chapter 26: Nonbusiness Casualty and Theft Losses
Nonbusiness  bad  debt.  If  you  do  not  choose  to  claim  the  loss  as  a  casualty  loss  for  purposes  of  
offsetting gains, you must wait until the year the actual loss is determined and deduct the loss as a 
nonbusiness bad debt in that year.
How to report. The kind of deduction you choose for your loss on deposits determines how you report 
your loss:
• Casualty loss—report it on Form 4684 and Schedule A (Form 1040).
• Nonbusiness bad debt—report it on Form 8949 first and Schedule D (Form 1040).
VI. PROOF OF LOSS
To deduct a casualty or theft loss, you must be able to prove that you had a casualty or theft. You also 
must be able to support the amount you take as a deduction.
Casualty loss proof. For a casualty loss, your records should show all the following:
• That you were the owner of the property or, if you leased the property from someone else, 
that you were contractually liable to the owner for the damage.
• The type of casualty (car accident, fire, storm, etc.) and when it occurred.
• That the loss was a direct result of the casualty.
• Whether a claim for reimbursement exists for which there is a reasonable expectation of 
recovery.
Theft loss proof. For a theft loss, your records should show all the following:
• That you were the owner of the property.
• That your property was stolen.
• When you discovered that your property was missing.
• Whether a claim for reimbursement exists for which there is a reasonable expectation of 
recovery.
VII. FIGURING A LOSS
Figure the amount of your loss using the following steps:
1. Determine your adjusted basis in the property before the casualty or theft.
2. Determine the decrease in fair market value (FMV) of the property as a result of the 
casualty or theft.
3. From the smaller of the amounts you determined in (1) and (2), subtract any insurance or 
other reimbursement you received or expect to receive.

 386  •  Chapter 26: Nonbusiness Casualty and Theft Losses
For personal-use property, apply the deduction limits, discussed later, to determine the amount of your 
deductible loss.
Gain from reimbursement. If your reimbursement is more than your adjusted basis in the property, you 
have a gain. This is true even if the decrease in the FMV of the property is smaller than your adjusted 
basis. If you have a gain, you may have to pay tax on it, or you may be able to postpone reporting the 
gain. 
Leased property. If you are liable for casualty damage to property you lease, your loss is the amount 
you must pay to repair the property minus any insurance or other reimbursement you receive or expect 
to receive.
DECREASE IN FMV
FMV is the price for which you could sell your property to a willing buyer when neither of you has to sell 
or buy and both of you know all the relevant facts.
The decrease in FMV used to figure the amount of a casualty or theft loss is the difference between the 
property’s FMV immediately before and immediately after the casualty or theft.
FMV of stolen property. The FMV of property immediately after a theft is considered to be zero because 
you no longer have the property.
Example
Several years ago, you purchased silver dollars at face value for $150. This is your 
adjusted basis in the property. Your silver dollars were stolen this year. The FMV of the 
coins was $1,000 just before they were stolen, and insurance did not cover them. Your 
theft loss is $150.
Recovered  stolen  property.  Recovered  stolen  property  is  your  property  that  was  stolen  and  later  
returned to you. If you recovered property after you had already taken a theft loss deduction, you must 
refigure your loss using the smaller of the property’s adjusted basis (explained later) or the decrease in 
FMV from the time just before it was stolen until the time it was recovered. Use this amount to refigure 
your total loss for the year in which the loss was deducted.
If your refigured loss is less than the loss you deducted, you generally have to report the difference as 
income in the recovery year. But report the difference only up to the amount of the loss that reduced your 
tax.
Figuring Decrease in FMV—Items To Consider
To figure the decrease in FMV because of a casualty or theft, you generally need a competent appraisal. 
However, other measures can also be used to establish certain decreases.

 387  •  Chapter 26: Nonbusiness Casualty and Theft Losses
Appraisal. An appraisal to determine the difference between the FMV of the property immediately before 
a casualty or theft and immediately afterward should be made by a competent appraiser. The appraiser 
must recognize the effects of any general market decline that may occur along with the casualty. This 
information is needed to limit any deduction to the actual loss resulting from damage to the property.
Several factors are important in evaluating the accuracy of an appraisal, including the following:
• The appraiser’s familiarity with your property before and after the casualty or theft.
• The appraiser’s knowledge of sales of comparable property in the area.
• The appraiser’s knowledge of conditions in the area of the casualty.
• The appraiser’s method of appraisal.
Tip
You may be able to use an appraisal that you used to get a federal loan (or a federal loan 
guarantee) as the result of a federally declared disaster to establish the amount of your 
disaster loss.
Cost of cleaning up or making repairs. The cost of repairing damaged property is not part of a casualty 
loss. Neither is the cost of cleaning up after a casualty. But you can use the cost of cleaning up or making 
repairs after a casualty as a measure of the decrease in FMV if you meet all the following conditions:
• The repairs are actually made.
• The repairs are necessary to bring the property back to its condition before the casualty.
• The amount spent for repairs is not excessive.
• The repairs take care of the damage only.
• The value of the property after the repairs is not, due to the repairs, more than the value 
of the property before the casualty.
Landscaping. The cost of restoring landscaping to its original condition after a casualty may indicate the 
decrease in FMV. You may be able to measure your loss by what you spend on the following:
• Removing destroyed or damaged trees and shrubs minus any salvage you receive.
• Pruning and other measures taken to preserve damaged trees and shrubs.
• Replanting necessary to restore the property to its approximate value before the casualty.
Car value. Books issued by various automobile organizations that list the manufacturer and the model 
of your car may be useful in figuring the value of your car. You can use the retail value for your car listed 

 388  •  Chapter 26: Nonbusiness Casualty and Theft Losses
in the book and modify it by such factors as mileage and the condition of your car to determine its value. 
The prices are not official, but they may be useful in determining value and suggesting relative prices for 
comparison with current sales and offerings in your area. If your car is not listed in the books, determine 
its value from other sources. A dealer’s offer for your car as a trade-in on a new car is not usually a 
measure of its true value.
Safe  harbor  procedures  to  determine  casualty  and  theft  loss  deduction. Safe harbor procedures 
allow filers to determine their casualty and theft loss deductions for personal-use residential real property 
and personal belongings resulting from a federally declared disaster without an appraisal. 
Figuring Decrease in FMV—Items Not To Consider
You generally should not consider the following items when attempting to establish the decrease in FMV 
of your property.
Cost  of  protection.  The  cost  of  protecting  your  property  against  a  casualty  or  theft  is  not  part  of  a  
casualty or theft loss. The amount you spend on insurance or to board up your house against a storm is 
not part of your loss.
If you make permanent improvements to your property to protect it against a casualty or theft, add the 
cost of these improvements to your basis in the property. An example would be the cost of a dike to 
prevent flooding.
Exception. You cannot increase your basis in the property by, or deduct as a business expense, any 
expenditures you made with respect to qualified disaster mitigation payments. 
Related  expenses. Any  incidental  expenses  due  to  a  casualty  or  theft,  such  as  expenses  for  the 
treatment of personal injuries, for temporary housing, or for a rental car, are not part of your casualty or 
theft loss.
Replacement cost. The cost of replacing stolen or destroyed property is not part of a casualty or theft 
loss.
Sentimental value. Do not consider sentimental value when determining your loss. If a family portrait, 
heirloom, or keepsake is damaged, destroyed, or stolen, you must base your loss on its FMV, as limited 
by your adjusted basis in the property.
Decline in market value of property in or near casualty area. A decrease in the value of your property 
because it is in or near an area that suffered a casualty, or that might again suffer a casualty, is not to be 
taken into consideration. You have a loss only for actual casualty damage to your property. However, if 
your home is in a federally declared disaster area, see Disaster Area Losses in Pub. 547.
Costs of photographs and appraisals. Photographs taken after a casualty will be helpful in establishing 
the condition and value of the property after it was damaged. Photographs showing the condition of the 
property after it was repaired, restored, or replaced may also be helpful.
Appraisals are used to figure the decrease in FMV because of a casualty or theft. 

 389  •  Chapter 26: Nonbusiness Casualty and Theft Losses
The  costs  of  photographs  and  appraisals  used  as  evidence  of  the  value  and  condition  of  property  
damaged as a result of a casualty are not a part of the loss. They are expenses in determining your tax 
liability. For tax years 2018 through 2025, they can no longer be deducted as miscellaneous itemized 
deductions.
ADJUSTED BASIS
Adjusted basis is your basis in the property (usually cost) increased or decreased by various events, 
such as improvements and casualty losses. 
INSURANCE AND OTHER REIMBURSEMENTS
If you receive an insurance payment or other type of reimbursement, you must subtract the reimbursement 
when you figure your loss. You do not have a casualty or theft loss to the extent you are reimbursed.
If in the year of the casualty there is a claim for reimbursement with a reasonable prospect of recovery, 
the loss is not sustained until you know with reasonable certainty whether such reimbursement will be 
received. If you expect to be reimbursed for part or all of your loss, you must subtract the expected 
reimbursement when you figure your loss. You must reduce your loss even if you do not receive payment 
until a later tax year. 
Failure to file a claim for reimbursement. If your property is covered by insurance, you must file 
a timely insurance claim for reimbursement of your loss. Otherwise, you cannot deduct this loss as 
a casualty or theft loss. However, this rule does not apply to the portion of the loss not covered by 
insurance (for example, a deductible).
Example
Your car insurance policy includes comprehensive coverage with a $1,000 deductible. 
Because your insurance does not cover the first $1,000 of damages resulting from a 
storm, the $1,000 is deductible (subject to the deduction limits discussed later). This is 
true even if you do not file an insurance claim, because your insurance policy will not 
reimburse you for the deductible.
Types of Reimbursements
The most common type of reimbursement is an insurance payment for your stolen or damaged property. 
Other types of reimbursements are discussed next. Also see the Instructions for Form 4684.
Employer’s emergency disaster fund. If you receive money from your employer’s emergency disaster 
fund and you must use that money to rehabilitate or replace property on which you are claiming a casualty 
loss deduction, you must take that money into consideration in figuring the casualty loss deduction. Take 
into consideration only the amount you used to replace your destroyed or damaged property.

 390  •  Chapter 26: Nonbusiness Casualty and Theft Losses
Example
Your home was extensively damaged by a tornado. Your loss after reimbursement from 
your insurance company was $10,000. Your employer set up a disaster relief fund for 
its employees. Employees receiving money from the fund had to use it to rehabilitate or 
replace their damaged or destroyed property. You received $4,000 from the fund and 
spent the entire amount on repairs to your home. In figuring your casualty loss, you 
must reduce your unreimbursed loss ($10,000) by the $4,000 you received from your 
employer’s fund. Your casualty loss before applying the deduction limits is $6,000.
Cash gifts. If you receive excludable cash gifts as a disaster victim and there are no limits on how you 
can use the money, you do not reduce your casualty loss by these excludable cash gifts. This applies 
even if you use the money to pay for repairs to property damaged in the disaster.
Example
Your home was damaged by a hurricane. Relatives and neighbors made cash gifts to 
you that were excludable from your income. You used part of the cash gifts to pay for 
repairs to your home. There were no limits or restrictions on how you could use the 
cash gifts. Because it was an excludable gift, the money you received and used to pay for 
repairs to your home does not reduce your casualty loss on the damaged home.
Insurance payments for living expenses. You do not reduce your casualty loss by insurance payments 
you receive to cover living expenses in either of the following situations:
• You lose the use of your main home because of a casualty.
• Government authorities do not allow you access to your main home because of a casualty 
or threat of one.
Inclusion in income. If these insurance payments are more than the temporary increase in your living 
expenses, you must include the excess in your income. Report this amount on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), 
line 8z. However, if the casualty occurs in a federally declared disaster area, none of the insurance 
payments are taxable. 
A temporary increase in your living expenses is the difference between the actual living expenses you 
and your family incurred during the period you could not use your home and your normal living expenses 
for that period. Actual living expenses are the reasonable and necessary expenses incurred because of 
the loss of your main home. Generally, these expenses include the amounts you pay for the following:
• Rent for suitable housing.
• Transportation.
• Food.

 391  •  Chapter 26: Nonbusiness Casualty and Theft Losses
• Utilities.
• Miscellaneous services.
Normal  living  expenses  consist  of  these  same  expenses  that  you  would  have  incurred  but  did  not 
because of the casualty or the threat of one.
Example
As a result of a hurricane, you vacated your apartment for a month and moved to a 
motel. You normally pay $525 a month for rent. None was charged for the month the 
apartment was vacated. Your motel rent for this month was $1,200. You normally pay 
$200 a month for food. Your food expenses for the month you lived in the motel were 
$400. You received $1,100 from your insurance company to cover your living expenses. 
You determine the payment you must include in income as follows:
1)Insurance payment for living expenses$1,100
2)Actual expenses during the month you are unable to 
use your home because of the hurricane
 
$1,600
3)Normal living expenses725
4)Temporary increase in living expenses: Subtract line 3 
from line 2
 
875
5)Amount   of   payment   includible   in   income:   
Subtract line 4 from line 1
 
$225
Tax year of inclusion. You include the taxable part of the insurance payment in income for the year you 
regain the use of your main home or, if later, for the year you receive the taxable part of the insurance 
payment.
Example
Your main home was destroyed by a tornado in June 2022. You regained use of your 
home in November 2023. The insurance payments you received in 2022 and 2023 were 
$1,500 more than the temporary increase in your living expenses during those years. 
You include this amount in income on your 2023 Form 1040. If, in 2024, you receive 
further payments to cover the living expenses you had in 2022 and 2023, you must 
include those payments in income on your 2024 Form 1040 or 1040-SR.
Disaster relief. Food, medical supplies, and other forms of assistance you receive do not reduce your 
casualty loss unless they are replacements for lost or destroyed property.

 392  •  Chapter 26: Nonbusiness Casualty and Theft Losses
Tip
 
Qualified disaster relief payments you receive for expenses you incurred as a result of a 
federally declared disaster are not taxable income to you.
Disaster unemployment assistance payments are unemployment benefits that are taxable.
Generally, disaster relief grants received under the Stafford Act are not includible in your income. 
Reimbursement Received After Deducting Loss
If you figured your casualty or theft loss using the amount of your expected reimbursement, you may 
have to adjust your tax return for the tax year in which you receive your actual reimbursement. This 
section explains the adjustment you may have to make.
Actual reimbursement less than expected. If you later receive less reimbursement than you expected, 
include that difference as a loss with your other losses (if any) on your return for the year in which you 
can reasonably expect no more reimbursement.
Example
Your personal car had an FMV of $2,000 when it was destroyed in a collision with 
another car in 2023. The accident was due to the negligence of the other driver. At the 
end of 2023, there was a reasonable prospect that the owner of the other car would 
reimburse you in full. You did not have a deductible loss in 2023.
In January 2024, the court awarded you a judgment of $2,000. However, in July it 
became apparent that you will be unable to collect any amount from the other driver. 
You can deduct the loss in 2024 (to the extent it does not exceed your 2024 personal 
casualty gains) subject to the deduction limits discussed later.
Actual  reimbursement  more  than  expected.  If  you  later  receive  a  larger  reimbursement  amount 
than  you  expected,  after  you  claimed  a  deduction  for  the  loss,  you  may  have  to  include  the  extra 
reimbursement amount in your income for the year you receive it. However, if any part of the original 
deduction did not reduce your tax for the earlier year, do not include that part of the reimbursement 
amount in your income. You do not refigure your tax for the year you claimed the deduction. 

 393  •  Chapter 26: Nonbusiness Casualty and Theft Losses
Caution!
If the total of all the reimbursements you receive is more than your adjusted basis in 
the destroyed or stolen property, you will have a gain on the casualty or theft. If you 
have already taken a deduction for a loss and you receive the reimbursement in a later 
year, you may have to include the gain in your income for the later year. Include the 
gain as ordinary income up to the amount of your deduction that reduced your tax for 
the earlier year.
Actual reimbursement same as expected. If you later receive exactly the reimbursement you expected 
to receive, you do not have to include any of the reimbursement in your income and you cannot deduct 
any additional loss.
Example
In December 2024, your personal car was damaged in a flood that was a federally 
declared disaster. Repairs to the car cost $950. You had $100 deductible comprehensive 
insurance. Your insurance company agreed to reimburse you for the rest of the damage. 
Because you expected a reimbursement from the insurance company, you did not have 
a casualty loss deduction in 2024.
Due to the $100 rule (discussed later under Deduction  Limits), you cannot deduct 
the $100 you paid as the deductible. When you receive the $850 from the insurance 
company in 2025, do not report it as income.
VIII. DEDUCTION LIMITS
After you have figured the amount of your casualty or theft loss, you must figure how much of the loss 
you can deduct. 
The deduction for casualty and theft losses of personal-use property is limited. For tax years beginning 
after 2017 and before 2026, personal casualty and theft losses of an individual are deductible only to the 
extent they are attributable to a federally declared disaster. The loss deduction is subject to the $100 and 
10% rules, discussed later.
An  exception  to  the  rule  above  limiting  the  personal  casualty  and  theft  loss  deduction  to  losses 
attributable to a federally declared disaster applies if you have personal casualty gains for the tax year. 
In this case, you may reduce your personal casualty gains by any casualty losses not attributable to a 
federally declared disaster. Any excess gain is used to reduce losses from a federally declared disaster. 
The 10% rule is applied to any federal disaster losses that remain.
You make these reductions on Form 4684.

 394  •  Chapter 26: Nonbusiness Casualty and Theft Losses
These rules are explained next and Table 26-1 summarizes how to apply the $100 rule and the 10% rule 
in various situations. 
TABLE   26-1   HOW   TO   APPLY   THE   DEDUCTION   LIMITS   FOR   PERSONAL-USE   
PROPERTY

General ApplicationYou must reduce each casualty 
or theft loss by $100 when 
figuring your deduction.  Apply 
this rule after you have figured 
the amount of your loss.*
You must reduce your total 
casualty or theft loss attributable 
to a federally declared disaster 
by 10% of your AGI.  Apply this 
rule after you reduce each loss 
by $100 ($100 rule).**

*Qualified disaster losses must be reduced by $500 when figuring your deduction. 
**The 10% rule does not apply to qualified disaster losses. 
Property used partly for business and partly for personal purposes. When property is used partly 
for personal purposes and partly for business or income-producing purposes, the casualty or theft loss 
deduction must be figured separately for the personal-use part and for the business or income-producing 
part. You must figure each loss separately because the $100 rule and the 10% rule apply only to the loss 
on the personal-use part of the property.
$100 RULE
After you have figured your casualty or theft loss on personal-use property, you must reduce that loss by 
$100. This reduction applies to each total casualty or theft loss, including those losses not attributable to 
a federally declared disaster that are applied to reduce your personal casualty gains. It does not matter 
how many pieces of property are involved in an event. Only a single $100 reduction applies.

 395  •  Chapter 26: Nonbusiness Casualty and Theft Losses
Example
You have $750 deductible collision insurance on your car. The car is damaged in a 
collision. The insurance company pays you for the damage minus the $750 deductible. 
The amount of the casualty loss is based solely on the deductible. The casualty loss is 
$650 ($750 - $100) because the first $100 of a casualty loss on personal-use property 
is not deductible.
Caution!
 
Qualified disaster losses must be reduced by $500 instead of $100. See Pub. 976 and 
the Instructions for Form 4684 for more information.
Single event. Generally, events closely related in origin cause a single casualty. It is a single casualty 
when the damage is from two or more closely related causes, such as wind and flood damage caused 
by the same storm.
10% RULE
You must reduce your total federal casualty losses by 10% of your AGI. Apply this rule after you reduce 
each loss by $100. If you have both gains and losses from casualties or thefts, see Gains and losses, 
later.
Example 1
In September, your house was damaged by a tropical storm that was a federally declared 
disaster. Your loss after insurance reimbursement was $2,000. Your AGI for the year 
the loss was sustained is $29,500. You first apply the $100 rule and then the 10% rule. 
Figure your casualty loss deduction as follows:
1)Loss after insurance$2,000
2)Subtract $100100
3)Loss after $100 rule$1,900
4)Subtract 10% × $29,500 AGI2,950
5)Casualty loss deduction-0-
You do not have a casualty loss deduction because your loss after you apply the $100 
rule ($1,900) is less than 10% of your AGI ($2,950).

 396  •  Chapter 26: Nonbusiness Casualty and Theft Losses
Caution!
 
The 10% rule does not apply to qualified disaster losses. 
More than one loss. If you have more than one casualty or theft loss during your tax year, reduce each 
loss by any reimbursement and by $100. Then, you must reduce your total federal casualty losses by 
10% of your AGI.
Example 2
In March, your car was destroyed in a flood that was a federally declared disaster. 
You  did  not  have  insurance  on  your  car,  so  you  did  not  receive  any  insurance 
reimbursement. Your loss on the car was $1,800. In November, another flood, which 
also was a federally declared disaster, damaged your basement and totally destroyed 
the furniture, washer, dryer, and other items stored there. Your loss on the basement 
items after reimbursement from your insurer was $2,100. Your AGI for the year that 
the floods occurred is $25,000. You figure your casualty loss deduction as follows:
CarBasement
1)Loss$1,800$2,100
2)Subtract $100 per incident100100
3)Loss after $100 rule$1,700$2,000
4)Total loss$3,700
5)Subtract 10% × $25,000 AGI2,500
6)Casualty loss deduction$1,200
Gains  and  losses. If you had both gains and losses from casualties or thefts to your personal-use 
property, you must compare your total gains to your total losses. Do this after you have reduced each 
loss by any reimbursements and by $100, but before you have reduced the federal casualty losses by 
10% of your AGI.
Caution!
 
Casualty or theft gains do not include gains you choose to postpone. 

 397  •  Chapter 26: Nonbusiness Casualty and Theft Losses
Losses  more  than  gains. If your losses are more than your recognized gains, subtract your gains 
from your losses and reduce the result by 10% of your AGI. The rest, if any, is your deductible loss from 
personal-use property. If you have losses not attributable to a federally declared disaster, see Line 14 in 
the Instructions for Form 4684. Losses not attributable to a federally declared disaster can only be used 
to offset gains.
Gains more than losses. If your recognized gains are more than your losses, subtract your losses from 
your gains. The difference is treated as capital gain and must be reported on Schedule D (Form 1040). 
The 10% rule does not apply to your gains. If you have losses not attributable to a federally declared 
disaster, see Line 14 in the Instructions for Form 4684.
IX. WHEN TO REPORT GAINS AND LOSSES
Gains. If you receive an insurance or other reimbursement that is more than your adjusted basis in the 
destroyed or stolen property, you have a gain from the casualty or theft. You must include this gain in 
your income in the year you receive the reimbursement, unless you choose to postpone reporting the 
gain.
Losses. Generally, you can deduct a casualty loss that is not reimbursable only in the tax year in which 
the casualty occurred. This is true even if you do not repair or replace the damaged property until a later 
year. (However, see Disaster Area Loss, later, for an exception.)
You can deduct theft losses that are not reimbursable only in the year you discover your property was 
stolen.
If in the year of the casualty there is a claim for reimbursement with a reasonable prospect of recovery, 
the loss is not sustained until you know with reasonable certainty whether such reimbursement will be 
received. If you are not sure whether part of your casualty or theft loss will be reimbursed, do not deduct 
that part until the tax year when you become reasonably certain that it will not be reimbursed. This later 
tax year is when your loss is sustained.
If you have a loss, see Table 26-2.

 398  •  Chapter 26: Nonbusiness Casualty and Theft Losses
Loss on deposits. If your loss is a loss on deposits in an insolvent or bankrupt financial institution, see 
Loss on Deposits, earlier.
DISASTER AREA LOSSES
A disaster loss is a loss that occurred in an area determined by the President of the United States 
to warrant assistance by the Federal government under the Stafford Act and that is attributable to a 
federally declared disaster. Disaster area includes areas warranting public or individual assistance (or 
both). A federally declared disaster includes a major disaster or emergency declaration.
You generally must deduct a casualty loss in the year it occurred. However, if you have a casualty loss 
from a federally declared disaster that occurred in an area warranting public or individual assistance (or 
both), you can elect to deduct the loss on your tax return or amended return for either of the following 
years:
• The year the loss was sustained (the disaster year).
• The year immediately preceding the disaster year.
You must make the election to take your casualty loss for the disaster in the preceding year on or before 
the date that is 6 months after the regular due date for filing your original return (without extensions) for 
the disaster year.
If you claimed a deduction for a disaster loss in the disaster year and you wish to deduct the loss in the 
preceding year, you must file an amended return to remove the previously deducted loss on or before 
you file the return or amended return for the preceding year that includes the disaster loss deduction. 
Gains. Special rules apply if you choose to postpone reporting gain on property damaged or destroyed 
in a federally declared disaster area. 
Postponed tax deadlines. The IRS may postpone for up to 1 year certain tax deadlines of taxpayers 
who are affected by a federally declared disaster. The tax deadlines the IRS may postpone include 
those for filing income and employment tax returns, paying income and employment taxes, and making 
contributions to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA.
If any tax deadline is postponed, the IRS will publicize the postponement in your area and publish a 
news release, and, where necessary, in a revenue ruling, revenue procedure, notice, announcement, or 
other guidance in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (IRB). 
Who  is  eligible.  If  the  IRS  postpones  a  tax  deadline,  the  following  taxpayers  are  eligible  for  the 
postponement:
•  Any individual whose main home is located in a covered disaster area (defined next).
• Any business entity or sole proprietor whose principal place of business is located in a 
covered disaster area.
• Any  individual  who  is  a  relief  worker  affiliated  with  a  recognized  government  or 
philanthropic organization who is assisting in a covered disaster area.

 399  •  Chapter 26: Nonbusiness Casualty and Theft Losses
• Any individual, business entity, or sole proprietorship whose records are needed to meet 
a postponed tax deadline, provided those records are maintained in a covered disaster 
area. The main home or principal place of business does not have to be located in the 
covered disaster area.
• Any estate or trust that has tax records necessary to meet a postponed tax deadline, 
provided those records are maintained in a covered disaster area.
• The spouse on a joint return with a taxpayer who is eligible for postponements.
• Any individual, business entity, or sole proprietorship not located in a covered disaster 
area, but whose records necessary to meet a postponed tax deadline are located in the 
covered disaster area.
• Any individual visiting the covered disaster area who was killed or injured as a result of 
the disaster.
• Any other person determined by the IRS to be affected by a federally declared disaster.
Covered disaster area. This is an area of a federally declared disaster in which the IRS has decided to 
postpone tax deadlines for up to 1 year.
Abatement  of  interest  and  penalties. The IRS may abate the interest and penalties on underpaid 
income tax for the length of any postponement of tax deadlines.
X. HOW TO REPORT GAINS AND LOSSES
Use Form 4684 to report a gain or a deductible loss from a casualty or theft. If you have more than one 
casualty or theft, use a separate Form 4684 to determine your gain or loss for each event. Combine the 
gains and losses on one Form 4684. Follow the form instructions as to which lines to fill out. In addition, 
you  must  use  the  appropriate  schedule  to  report  a  gain  or  loss.  The  schedule  you  use  depends  on  
whether you have a gain or loss.
If you have a:Report it on:
GainSchedule D (Form 1040)
LossSchedule A (Form 1040)
Adjustments to basis. If you have a casualty or theft loss, you must decrease your basis in the property 
by any insurance or other reimbursement you receive, and by any deductible loss. If you make either 
of the basis adjustments described above, amounts you spend on repairs to restore your property to its 
pre-casualty condition increase your adjusted basis. 
Net operating loss (NOL). If your casualty or theft loss deduction causes your deductions for the year 
to be more than your income for the year, you may have an NOL. You do not have to be in business to 
have an NOL from a casualty or theft loss.

information presented in the chapter (assignment). They are included as an additional tool to enhance 
your learning experience and do not need to be submitted in order to receive CPE credit. 
We recommend that you answer each question and then compare your response to the suggested 
solutions on the following page(s) before answering the final exam questions related to this chapter 
(assignment).
1.
Casualty and theft loss deductions were suspended for 2018-2025 unless in 
a federally declared disaster area or to the extent of a casualty gain.
A. true
B. false
2.
Items to consider when figuring the decrease in FMV because of a casualty 
or theft include which of the following:
A. an appraisal
B. the cost of protection
C. the replacement cost
D. any sentimental value

 401  •  Chapter 26: Nonbusiness Casualty and Theft Losses
CHAPTER 26: SOLUTIONS AND SUGGESTED RESPONSES
Below are the solutions and suggested responses for the questions on the previous page(s). If you 
choose an incorrect answer, you should review the pages as indicated for each question to ensure 
comprehension of the material.
1.A. CORRECT. This law change was a part of the TCJA of 2017.
B. Incorrect. The TCJA of 2017 eliminated many deductions, including all miscellaneous 
itemized deductions subject to the 2% of AGI limitation.
(See page 383 of the course material.)
2.A. CORRECT. An appraisal should be used to determine the difference between the FMV 
of the property immediately before a casualty or theft and immediately afterward. The 
appraiser must recognize the effects of any general market decline that may occur 
along with the casualty. This information is needed to limit any deduction to the actual 
loss resulting from damage to the property.
B. Incorrect. The cost of protecting your property against a casualty or theft is not part of a 
casualty or theft loss. For example, the amount you spend on insurance or to board up 
your house against a storm is not part of your loss.
C. Incorrect. The cost of replacing stolen or destroyed property is not part of a casualty or 
theft loss.
D. Incorrect.  Do  not  consider  sentimental  value  when  determining  your  loss.  You  must  
base your loss only on an item’s FMV.
(See pages 391 to 393 of the course material.)

CHAPTER 27: OTHER ITEMIZED DEDUCTIONS
Chapter Objective
After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• Identify types of other itemized deductions allowable to reduce adjusted gross income.
I.   WHAT’S NEW/REMINDERS
No miscellaneous itemized deductions allowed. You can no longer claim any miscellaneous itemized 
deductions. See Miscellaneous Itemized Deductions, later.
Standard mileage rate. The 2024 rate for business use of a vehicle is 67.0 cents per mile.
II. INTRODUCTION
This chapter explains that you can no longer claim any miscellaneous itemized deductions, unless you 
fall into one of the qualified categories of employment claiming a deduction relating to unreimbursed 
employee expenses. Miscellaneous itemized deductions are those deductions that would have been

gross  income  limitation,  including  unreimbursed  employee  expenses.  However,  you  may  be  able  to 
deduct certain unreimbursed employee business expenses if you fall into one of the following categories 
of employment listed under Unreimbursed Employee Expenses, next.

the following categories of employment.

• Qualified performing artists.
• Fee-basis state or local government officials.
• Employees with impairment-related work expenses.
CATEGORIES OF EMPLOYMENT
You can deduct unreimbursed employee expenses only if you qualify as an Armed Forces reservist, 
qualified performing artist, fee-basis state or local government official, and employee with impairment-
related work expenses.
Armed  Forces  reservist  (member  of  a  reserve  component).  You  are  a  member  of  a  reserve 
component of the Armed Forces of the United States if you are in the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air 
Force, or Coast Guard Reserve; the Army National Guard of the United States; or the Reserve Corps of

 404  •  Chapter 27: Other Itemized Deductions
Employee  with  impairment-related  work  expenses.  Impairment-related  work  expenses  are  the 
allowable expenses of an individual with physical or mental disabilities for attendant care at his or her 
place of employment. They also include other expenses in connection with the place of employment that 
enable the employee to work. 
Allowable unreimbursed employee expenses. If you qualify as an employee in one of the categories 
mentioned above, you may be able to deduct the following items as unreimbursed employee expenses.
Unreimbursed employee expenses for individuals in these categories of employment are deducted as 
adjustments to gross income. Qualified employees listed in one of the categories above must complete 
Form 2106 to take the deduction.
You can deduct only unreimbursed employee expenses that are:
• Paid or incurred during your tax year,
• For carrying on your trade or business of being an employee, and
• Ordinary and necessary.
An expense is ordinary if it is common and accepted in your trade, business, or profession. An expense 
is necessary if it is appropriate and helpful to your business. An expense does not have to be required to 
be considered necessary.
EDUCATOR EXPENSES
If you were an eligible educator in 2024, you can deduct up to $300 of qualified expenses you paid in 2024 
as an adjustment to gross income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 11, rather than as a miscellaneous 
itemized deduction. If you and your spouse are filing jointly and both of you were eligible educators, the 
maximum deduction is $600. However, neither spouse can deduct more than $300 of his or her qualified 
expenses. 
EXPENSES YOU CANNOT DEDUCT
Because of the suspension of miscellaneous itemized deductions, there are two categories of expenses 
you  cannot  deduct:  Miscellaneous  itemized  deductions  subject  to  the  2% AGI  limitation,  and  those 
expenses  that  are  traditionally  nondeductible  under  the  Internal  Revenue  Code.  Both  categories  of 
deduction are discussed next.
Miscellaneous Deductions Subject to 2% AGI
Unless  you  fall  into  one  of  the  qualified  categories  of  employment  under Unreimbursed  Employee  
Expenses, earlier, miscellaneous itemized deductions that are subject to the 2% of adjusted gross income 
limitation can no longer be claimed. For expenses not related to unreimbursed employee expenses, you 
generally cannot deduct the following expenses, even if you fall into one of the qualified categories of 
employment listed earlier.

LIST OF DEDUCTIONS
Each of the following items is discussed in detail after the list (except where indicated).
• Amortizable premium on taxable bonds.

• Unlawful discrimination claims.
• Unrecovered investment in an annuity.
Amortizable Premium on Taxable Bonds
In general, if the amount you pay for a bond is greater than its stated principal amount, the excess 
is bond premium. You can elect to amortize the premium on taxable bonds. The amortization of the 
premium is generally an offset to interest income on the bond rather than a separate deduction item.
Part of the premium on some bonds may be an itemized deduction on Schedule A (Form 1040 ). 

 414  •  Chapter 27: Other Itemized Deductions
Casualty and Theft Losses of Income-Producing Property
You can deduct a casualty or theft loss as an itemized deduction on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 16, 
if the damaged or stolen property was income-producing property (property held for investment, such 
as stocks, notes, bonds, gold, silver, vacant lots, and works of art). First, report the loss in Form 4684, 
Section B. You may also have to include the loss on Form 4797, if you are otherwise required to file that 
form. To figure your deduction, add all casualty or theft losses from this type of property included on 
Form 4684, lines 32 and 38b, or Form 4797, line 18a. For more information on casualty and theft losses, 
see chapter 26.
Excess Deductions of an Estate or Trust
Generally, if an estate or trust has an excess deduction resulting from total deductions being greater than 
its gross income, in the estate’s or trust’s last tax year, a beneficiary can deduct the excess deductions, 
depending on its character. The excess deductions retain their character as an adjustment to arrive at 
adjusted gross income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), as a non-miscellaneous itemized deduction, or as a 
miscellaneous itemized deduction. For more information on excess deductions of an estate or trust, see 
the Instructions for Schedule K-1 (Form 1041) for a Beneficiary Filing Form 1040.
Federal Estate Tax on Income in Respect of a Decedent
You can deduct the federal estate tax attributable to income in respect of a decedent that you as a 
beneficiary include in your gross income. Income in respect of the decedent is gross income that the 
decedent  would  have  received  had  death  not  occurred  and  that  was  not  properly  includible  in  the 
decedent’s final income tax return.
Gambling Losses up to the Amount of Gambling Winnings
You must report the full amount of your gambling winnings for the year on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), 
line 8b. You deduct your gambling losses for the year on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 16. You cannot 
deduct gambling losses that are more than your winnings.
Caution!
You cannot reduce your gambling winnings by your gambling losses and report the 
difference. You must report the full amount of your winnings as income and claim 
your losses (up to the amount of winnings) as an itemized deduction. Therefore, your 
records should show your winnings separately from your losses.

 415  •  Chapter 27: Other Itemized Deductions
Tip
Diary of winnings and losses. You must keep an accurate diary or similar record of 
your losses and winnings.

establishment.

Impairment-Related Work Expenses
If you have a physical or mental disability that limits your being employed, or substantially limits one 
or more of your major life activities, such as performing manual tasks, walking, speaking, breathing, 
learning, and working, you can deduct your impairment-related work expenses.
Impairment-related work expenses are ordinary and necessary business expenses for attendant care 
services at your place of work and for other expenses in connection with your place of work that are 
necessary for you to be able to work.
Self-employed.  If  you  are  self-employed,  enter  your  impairment-related  work  expenses  on  the 
appropriate form (Schedule C, E, or F) used to report your business income and expenses.
Repayments Under Claim of Right
If you had to repay more than $3,000 that you included in your income in an earlier year because at the 
time you thought you had an unrestricted right to it, you may be able to deduct the amount you repaid or 
take a credit against your tax. See Repayments in chapter 12 for more information.
Unlawful Discrimination Claims
You may be able to deduct, as an adjustment to income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 24h, attorney 
fees and court costs for actions settled or decided after October 22, 2004, involving a claim of unlawful 
discrimination, a claim against the U.S. Government, or a claim made under section 1862(b)(3)(A) of 
the Social Security Act. However, the amount you can deduct on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 24h, is 
limited to the amount of the judgment or settlement you are including in income for the tax year.

 416  •  Chapter 27: Other Itemized Deductions
Unrecovered Investment in Annuity
A retiree who contributed to the cost of an annuity can exclude from income a part of each payment 
received as a tax-free return of the retiree’s investment. If the retiree dies before the entire investment is 
recovered tax free, any unrecovered investment can be deducted on the retiree’s final income tax return. 
See chapter 10 for more information about the tax treatment of pensions and annuities.

 420  •  Chapter 28: Section 199A Pass-Through Income Deduction
CHAPTER 28: SECTION 199A PASS-THROUGH 
INCOME DEDUCTION
Chapter Objective
After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• Identify the rules in the TCJA related to claiming a deduction for “qualified business income.”
Note: This chapter has been updated with the Final Regulations and Other IRS Guidance issued by the 
IRS in January 2019 and inflation adjusted numbers for 2024.
I.   ¶4.01 QUALIFIED BUSINESS INCOME
Probably the most complex and far-reaching rule contained in the TCJA is the ability to claim a deduction 
for “qualified business income.” This rule, contained in Code Section 199A, permits proprietors, partners 
and S corporation shareholders to claim a deduction for up to 20% of the taxable income from their 
enterprises. This new deduction is termed the “Section 199A deduction” or the “QBI deduction.”
The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 had added a deduction for Income Attributable to Domestic 
Production  Activities.  [Code  Sec.  199]  This  rule  allowed  a  deduction  for  certain  income  of  various  
domestic production activities − up to 9% of taxable income. To allay some concerns about exportation 
of jobs, this deduction was limited to 50% of the W-2 wages paid in a taxable year. Thus, outsourcing 
of jobs could mean the loss of part of the base for the deduction. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act repealed 
this deduction, but retained the 50% of W-2 wage rule for the QBI deduction. To accommodate real 
estate enterprises, which do not always have significant W-2 wage payments, Section 199A provides an 
alternate test using the basis of depreciable property.
As of 2018, two tax savings mechanisms replaced the former Section 199, Domestic Production Activities 
Deduction:
1. Reduction of the C corporation rate to 21%; and
2. A special deduction for noncorporate taxpayers for qualified business income (QBI).
However, the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 [P.L. 115-141] restored the rules of former 
Section 199 for cooperatives. [P.L. 115-141, Sec. 101(b)(2)(A), Div. T]
DEDUCTION FOR QUALIFIED BUSINESS INCOME (QBI)
Code Section 199A permits a deduction for 20% of certain income from partnerships, proprietorships 
and S corporations. It also applies to dividends from real estate investment trusts (REITs), income from 
publicly-traded partnerships (PTPs) and certain payments from cooperatives (COOPs) to their patrons.

 421  •  Chapter 28: Section 199A Pass-Through Income Deduction
The deduction is 20% of the qualifying income, but is limited to 20% of the individual’s taxable income, 
reduced for items taxed as net capital gains (long-term capital gains and qualified dividends). [Code 
Sec. 199A(a)(1)(B)] The deduction is taken below AGI, although it is available in full for taxpayers who 
itemize or those who use the standard deduction. [Code Sec. 63(b)(3)]
The  rules  for  income  from  Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and Publicly Traded Partnerships 
(PTPs)  are  straightforward.  Commercial  businesses,  professional  service  businesses  and  farms  are 
subject to the most complex rules described below.
• The rules require separate computations for each separate trade or business;
• The income and other items must be effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business;
• There  are  special  rules  based  on  the  taxpayer’s  taxable  income  (before  the  §  199A 
deduction);
• Wage, salary and retirement income are not components of QBI;
• Dividends, including qualified dividends, are not components of QBI;
• Capital gains and losses do not directly enter into the computation of QBI, but these items 
may affect the ultimate deduction.
Comment
The QBI deduction was written hastily, and was amended several times between its 
initial exposure in the Senate draft bill and the product that ultimately became law. 
The various drafters omitted detailed rules which may be necessary to apply the law 
in its intended manner. Some of these might take the form of technical corrections 
or other statutory changes down the road. However, the IRS has specific and broad 
regulatory authority to interpret Section 199A. [Code Sec. 199A(f )(4)] Therefore, its 
interpretations will have substantial weight of authority and will not be easy to challenge 
successfully. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 has already amended rules 
concerning cooperatives and their patrons.  
INCOME FROM REITs AND PTPs 
A REIT is a domestic corporation, or association treated as a corporation for federal tax purposes, which 
qualifies and elects to be treated as a REIT. [Code Sec. 856] Substantially all of its income and assets 
must be connected with real estate. It must have 100 or more owners and cannot be controlled by a 
small group. It must distribute at least 90% of its taxable income.
A REIT is taxable as a corporation, except that it deducts the dividends paid to its owners. The owners 
include the dividends from the REIT as gross income. Some of the dividends may be treated as capital 
gains and others as ordinary income. [Code Sec. 857]

 422  •  Chapter 28: Section 199A Pass-Through Income Deduction
Comment
REITs are subject to several complex rules as to permissible income, assets and activities. 
These rules are beyond the scope of this Guide, and are found in Code Sections 856–
860.
A  PTP  exists  when  interests  in  the  partnership  are  traded  on  an  established  securities  market  or 
secondary market. [Code Sec. 7704(b)] A PTP is treated as a corporation unless 90% or more of its 
gross income is from “passive-type” sources. [Code Sec. 7704(c)] These sources are interest, dividends, 
real property rents, gains from the disposition of real property, income from oil, gas, mineral and other 
natural resources, and gains from disposition of any assets used in these income-producing activities. 
[Code Sec. 7704(d)] There are special rules relating to commodities.
A  distribution  from  a REIT  to  an  individual  is  not  QBI,  per  se.  [Code  Sec.  199A(c)(1)]  However,  a 
distribution from a REIT qualifies for the 20% deduction if it is not treated as a capital gain or qualified 
dividend. [Code Sec. 199A(b)(1)(B), 199A(e)(3)] Similarly, an individual’s share of income from a PTP is 
not QBI, although it qualifies for the 20% deduction.
The shareholder deduction for QBI from a REIT or PTP does not depend on the W-2 wages or qualified 
property of the entity. However, a PTP must have qualifying income from a U.S. trade or business. A PTP 
may have items of income and gain that do not qualify for the QBI deduction. As a reporting entity, a PTP 
must inform its partners about the income items that do qualify for this deduction.
Gains from dispositions of interests in REITs and PTPs are generally capital gains. However, if a PTP 
has unrealized receivables or substantially appreciated inventory items, some or all of the gain on the 
disposition of an interest in a partnership may be ordinary income. [Code Sec. 751(a)] Ordinary income 
resulting from the disposition of a PTP qualifies for the QBI deduction.
Comment
Given the requirements for the income and assets of a qualifying PTP, it is unlikely 
that unrealized receivables and substantially appreciated inventory items would be a 
significant portion of the partnership’s assets. Therefore, it is unlikely that many gains 
from the disposition of interests in these entities will be treated as ordinary income.
The deduction for income from a REIT or PTP is the easiest to compute. There is no reference to W-2 
wages, qualified property or the taxpayer’s taxable income, except for the overall limit. The deduction is 
the lesser of 20% of the REIT or PTP income or 20% of the individual’s taxable income (excluding gains 
and dividends taxed at capital gain rates).

 423  •  Chapter 28: Section 199A Pass-Through Income Deduction
Example 1
Jeannie, a single individual, has the following income in 2024:
Salary$100,000
Dividends from REITs (ordinary income)50,000
Income from PTPs40,000
AGI$190,000
Her itemized deductions are $31,000. Thus, her taxable income is $159,000, before 
any QBI deduction. She calculates her base for the QBI deduction as the lesser of:
Income from REITs and PTPs$90,000

199A Deduction$18,000
When some of the taxable income is taxed as a net capital gain there is another limitation. Since capital 
gain  tax  rates  already  provide  an  advantage  over  ordinary  income,  this  amount  of  taxable  income 
reduces the base for the QBI deduction. [Code Sec. 199A(2)(B)]

INCOME FROM SOURCES OTHER THAN REITs AND PTPs
For business income other than from REITs and PTPs, there are several requirements, some of which 
depend upon the taxpayer’s level of income. Rules that do not fluctuate with the taxpayer’s income level 
include:
• The income must be effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business; [Code Sec. 
199A(c)(3)(A)(i)]
• Certain income is not QBI, even if it is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business; 
[Code Sec. 199A(c)(3)(B)]
• Each taxpayer must compute a separate deduction for each trade or business. [Code 
Sec. 199A(b)(2)]
Provisions that vary with the taxpayer’s income are:
• The deduction is generally limited to 20% of the taxable income if taxable income is less 
than the taxpayer’s QBI. [Code Sec. 199A(a)(1)(B)(i)]
• Income from a specified service business may or may not be part of the base for the QBI 
deduction, depending on the amount of taxable income and the taxpayer’s filing status. 
[Code Sec. 199A(d)(1)(A), 199A(d)(3)]
• For a business other than specified service activity, the deduction may or may not depend 
on W-2 wages paid by the taxpayer or qualified property held by the taxpayer, depending 
on the amount of taxable income and the taxpayer’s filing status. [Code Sec. 199A(b)(2)]

 425  •  Chapter 28: Section 199A Pass-Through Income Deduction
EFFECTIVELY CONNECTED WITH TRADE OR BUSINESS WITHIN U.S.
To be QBI, the income must be effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. [Code Sec. 199A(c)
(3)(A)(i)] This rule borrows from Code Section 864(c), in Subchapter N, Tax  Based  on  Income  from  
Sources Within or Without the United States.
The U.S. place of business is also a material factor if it is used for management of U.S. sales, rents or 
royalties. [Reg. § 1.864-6(b)(2)] Thus, rentals and royalties from U.S. property are clearly within this 
requirement. Any business conducted in Puerto Rico is treated as a U.S. trade or business for this 
purpose. [Code Sec. 199A(f )(1)(C)(i)]
Section 864(c) contains several rules applicable to foreign persons and entities and most of its language 
is concerned with what is not U.S. source income. The principal test is based on having an office or other 
fixed place of business within the U.S., if the place is a material factor in the realization of the income, 
gain, or loss, and if the income, gain, or loss is realized in the ordinary course of the trade or business 
carried on through that office or other fixed place of business. [Reg. § 1.864-6(b)(1)]
INCOME NOT TREATED AS QUALIFIED BUSINESS INCOME
Certain income is not QBI, even if it is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. [Code Sec. 
199A(c)(3)(B)]
These items include:
• Long-term and short-term capital gains and losses;
• Dividends and equivalents (other than patronage dividends from cooperatives); 
• Interest (other than that properly allocable to a trade or business); and
• Annuities (unless properly allocable to a trade or business).
In addition, wage or salary income received from the activity does not constitute QBI for an S corporation 
shareholder-employee. [Code Sec. 199A(c)(4)(A)] Similarly, guaranteed payments received by a partner, 
as well as any amounts received by a partner in a nonpartner capacity do not count as QBI. [Code Sec. 
199A(c)(4)(B), (C)]

 426  •  Chapter 28: Section 199A Pass-Through Income Deduction
Example 3
Sandy and Paul are the sole and equal shareholders of Sapco, an S corporation. Sandy is 
the president and active manager of the corporation’s business. Paul, her brother, lives 
in another state and is a passive investor. All of the business income in 2023 is QBI. 
The net income, after payment of Sandy’s $200,000 salary, is $600,000. There are 
no other employees of Sapco. Sandy and Paul would each treat $300,000 as qualified 
business income and would each treat their portions of Sandy’s salary as qualifying 
W-2 wages (see discussion below). Therefore, assuming that both shareholders had 
taxable income in excess of the threshold and phaseout limits, they could claim a QBI 
deduction of $50,000, the lesser of 20% of QBI or 50% of their allocable W-2 wages. 
Sandy cannot claim any of her salary as QBI.
Example 4
Assume the same facts in Example 3 except that Sapco is a limited liability company, 
treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. Sandy’s compensation is a 
guaranteed payment for services. Since guaranteed payments are not reported on Form 
W-2, Sapco has no qualifying W-2 wages. If the partners are above the threshold and 
phaseout ranges, they cannot claim any QBI deduction.
These rules do not restrict QBI to ordinary income, per se. As a matter of fact, due to the incorporation 
of the Section 864 rules, gains from sales of property used in a U.S. trade or business are not excluded 
from QBI.
Example 5
Salty, an S corporation realized  $85,000 of  ordinary income  in 2024. It also  sold 
some business assets, resulting in a $25,000 depreciation recapture and $45,000 of 
Section 1231 gain from the sale of depreciated real estate. Salty also reported interest 
and dividend income of $10,000 from portfolio investments. Salty has no sources of 
income from outside the U.S.
The ordinary income and the depreciation recapture are taxable at ordinary income 
rates. Thus, if any shareholder is at the highest income bracket, and has sufficient 
taxable income to deduct the entire 20% from Salty, the effective tax rate on this income 
is 29.6% (80% x 37%). Assuming that the Section 1231 gain is not converted to ordinary 
income by the five-year lookback rule, it is not treated as part of QBI.

 427  •  Chapter 28: Section 199A Pass-Through Income Deduction
Example 5 (continued)
Sally, the sole shareholder of Salty, has no Section 1231 losses in the current or past five 
years. Her Section 1231 gain is not QBI. She computes her QBI from Salty as:
Ordinary income$85,000
Depreciation recapture25,000
QBI$110,000
TAXABLE INCOME THRESHOLD RULES
Some of the most important tax planning needs to focus on increasing or decreasing taxable income to 
get certain results for the QBI deduction. Important limits apply to individual taxpayers, based on their 
level of taxable income.
• If taxable income is below a certain threshold, income from specified services constitutes 
qualified business income. If the income is above the threshold, this income does not 
qualify for the QBI deduction.
• If  income  is  below  the  threshold,  the  deduction  for  income  from  a  trade  or  business 
other than a specified service activity is not dependent upon the W-2 wages paid by the 
business or the qualified property held by the business. If the taxpayer’s income exceeds 
the threshold, the deduction for QBI is limited by one or both of these factors.
When income exceeds the threshold, there is a phaseout range. When taxable income exceeds the 
threshold, but is within the phaseout range, the limits apply in part. When taxable income exceeds the 
threshold plus the phaseout range, the limits apply in full. The threshold rules depend on the taxpayer’s 
filing status. [Code Sec. 199A(e)(2)]. The thresholds, but not the phaseout ranges, are indexed after 
2018.

 428  •  Chapter 28: Section 199A Pass-Through Income Deduction
SEPARATE COMPUTATION FOR EACH TRADE OR BUSINESS
Code Section 199A requires a separate computation of the income and other limits for each qualified 
trade or business. [Code Sec. 199A(b)(1)(A), Code Sec. 199A(c)(1)] Accordingly, a taxpayer with more 
than one trade or business may not mix the income of one activity with the W-2 wages or qualified 
property of another.
Determination of what constitutes a separate trade or business will be problematic for planning and 
compliance with the new deduction. In some cases, taxpayers may want to separate certain activities, 
especially when one activity is a specified service business, and another is not.
In other cases, taxpayers will want to combine business ventures so that the income from one enterprise 
can draw upon the W-2 wages or qualified property of another.
Aggregation of Multiple Trades or Businesses
The Code does not specify rules for aggregation and separation. According to the regulations, each 
business  activity  must  be  treated  as  a  separate  trade  or  business  unless  aggregation  is  permitted. 
[Reg.  §1.199A-4(a)]  The  regulations  contain  some  specific  aggregation  rules. A  pass-through  entity 
that  conducts  more  than  one  business  may  aggregate,  if  the  businesses  meet  the  ownership  and 
business relationship rules and if none of the businesses to be aggregated are specified service trades 
or  businesses  (SSTBs).  If  a  pass-through  entity  elects  to  aggregate  businesses,  each  partner  or 
shareholder is bound by the aggregation of those particular businesses.
Each partner or shareholder may also be allowed to aggregate activities. This aggregation could include 
businesses conducted by one or more S corporations or partnerships, even if the entities did not elect 
to aggregate. However, in order to aggregate, all of the owners’ aggregate activities must meet the 
ownership and business relationship tests as discussed below.
The Ownership Tests
There are three basic rules governing the ownership tests.
1. In order to aggregate, a person, entity, or group must own at least 50% of each trade 
or business. [Reg. §1.199A-4(b)(1)(i)] The ownership must be outright ownership of the 
entire activity, stock (in S corporations) and capital or profits interest (in partnerships).
2. There must be common ownership for a majority of the taxable year in question. [Reg. 
§1.199A-4(b)(1)(ii)]
3. All of the businesses must use the same taxable year, not including short years. [Reg. 
§1.199A-4(b)(1)(iii)]
A taxpayer uses the rules of Code Sections 267(b) and 707(b) to determine constructive ownership for 
purposes of the aggregation rules. [Reg. §1.199A-4(b)(1)(i)]

 429  •  Chapter 28: Section 199A Pass-Through Income Deduction
The Business Relationship Tests
Each of the eligible businesses must share at least two of these attributes with the others:
1. The products or services must be the same or complementary;
2. The businesses must share the same facilities or business functions such as accounting, 
and payroll, advertising, etc.; and
3. There must be interdependence between (or among) the businesses. [Reg. §1.199A-4(b)
(1)(v)]
Aggregation Election by Pass-Through Entity
The primary burdens on the pass-through entity in this situation are reporting income, deductions, gains, 
losses, etc., to shareholders and accounting for separate and combined lines of business. The burdens 
of disallowance, and the benefits of deducting suspended losses, fall entirely on the owners.
Once a pass-through entity makes a grouping election, the owners must group those activities with each 
other, with activities conducted directly by the taxpayer, or with activities conducted through other S 
corporations or partnerships, in accordance with the same criteria. [Reg. §1.199A-4(b)(2)(ii)]
Example 6
Green, LLC has several partners. Green owns and operates a highway center. The center 
has a gas and diesel station, a convenience store and a fast food franchise. Each of these 
businesses has separate books and records. If Green treats these enterprises as separate 
activities, each of the owners may group the income or loss from each enterprise with 
income or loss from other enterprises of a similar nature, assuming that the other 
activities meet all tests for aggregation with Green’s businesses. If Green aggregates 
the three as a single business, no shareholder will be able to disaggregate the grouping.
Aggregation by Shareholder or Partner
A shareholder or partner may not treat activities owned by a pass-through entity as separate activities if 
the entity has grouped them together. However, the owners may group certain activities together. This 
could be useful when combining attributes of separate activities could match income with one venture 
with W-2 wages paid by another activity or with the qualified property owned by an enterprise under 
common control. See discussion of these limits below.

 430  •  Chapter 28: Section 199A Pass-Through Income Deduction
Example 7
Sally and Vic are married and file a joint return. Vic is the sole shareholder of Vic’s 
Market, an S corporation that operates a grocery store. Sally is the sole shareholder 
of J Co., which owns a building and rents it to Vic’s Market. This arrangement has 
been in effect for the entire taxable year. Under Code Section 267(b), Sally and Vic are 
each treated as the owner of each other’s property. Therefore, the rental and grocery 
meet  the  ownership  test  required  for  aggregation.  The  store  and  the  building  are 
also interdependent. They are also at the same location. Therefore, Vic and Sally can 
aggregate the rental and the grocery operation.
The net income from the market and the net income from the rent would be treated as 
QBI from one business. Sally and Vic would also be able to use the qualified property 
limit from the rental as one of the factors determining the deduction for the income of 
the combined entity.
SPECIFIED SERVICE TRADE OR BUSINESS RULES
Any taxpayer whose taxable income exceeds the threshold plus phaseout is not able to claim a deduction 
for  income  from  a  “specified service trade or business.”  This  rule  begins  by  borrowing  a  definition 
from Code Section 1202(e)(3)(A), but then makes some modifications. Section 1202(e)(3)(A) lists the 
following activities as being service businesses:
• Health
• Law
• Engineering (but see below for Section 199A)
• Architecture (but see below for Section 199A)
• Accounting
• Actuarial Science
• Performing Arts
• Consulting
• Athletics
• Financial Services
• Brokerage Services, or
• Any trade or business where the principal asset of such trade or business is the reputation 
or skill of 1 or more of its employees.

 431  •  Chapter 28: Section 199A Pass-Through Income Deduction
The regulations treat the reputation of owners or employees as the principal asset of an SSTB only 
under the following limited circumstances: [Reg. §1.199A-5(b)(2)(xiv)]
• Fees, compensation, or other income is received for endorsing products or services;
• Licenses or fees, compensation, or other income for the use of an individual’s image, 
likeness, name, signature, voice, trademark, or any other symbols associated with the 
individual’s identity is received;
• Fees, compensation, or other income for appearing at an event or on radio, television, or 
another media format is received.
Example 8
Ed’s Eatery, Inc., an S corporation, owns a gourmet restaurant in an out of the way 
location. Since Ed’s Eatery hired Esther Epicurean, a widely-renowned chef, it is booked 
every night of the week, and customers need to reserve tables several days in advance. 
Ed’s Eatery is not treated as an SSTB.
Section 199A adds investing and investment management, trading, or dealing in securities, partnership 
interests, or commodities to the list of specified services. [Code Sec. 199A(d)(2)(B)]
However, Section 199A specifically excludes engineering and architecture. Thus, these professions are 
governed by the commercial business rules.
TAXABLE INCOME DOES NOT EXCEED THRESHOLD
Taxpayers whose taxable income does not exceed the threshold described in Table 1 treat income from 
a specified service business as QBI. Thus, if a taxpayer’s AGI less the standard deduction or itemized 
deductions does not exceed $191,950 ($383,900 for married filing joint returns), all of the specified 
service business income is QBI. [Code Sec. 199A(d)(3)(A)(i)]
Example 9
Dino, a single individual, has the following income in 2024:
Qualified dividends$10,000
Income from law practice, sole practitioner120,000
Other ordinary income, not from trade or business, rent or royalty15,000
Self-employment tax deduction(8,478)
AGI$145,000
Dino does not itemize deductions. Subtracting the standard deduction of $14,600 from 
his AGI, his taxable income is $130,400. He must determine whether or not his taxable 
income (before the Section 199A deduction) is under the threshold of $191,950. 

 432  •  Chapter 28: Section 199A Pass-Through Income Deduction

When a person’s taxable income exceeds the threshold limit of $191,950 ($383,900 for married filing 
joint return) plus the phaseout range of $50,000 ($100,000 for married filing joint return), none of the 
income from a specified service business is QBI.

Qualified dividends$10,000
Income from law practice, sole practitioner250,000
Other ordinary income, not from trade or business, rent or royalty15,000
Self-employment tax deduction12,056

 433  •  Chapter 28: Section 199A Pass-Through Income Deduction
Example 10 (continued)
Dino does not itemize deductions. Subtracting the standard deduction of $14,600 from 
his AGI, his taxable income is $248,344. He must determine whether or not his taxable 
income (before the Section 199A deduction) is under the threshold of $191,950 plus the 
$50,000 phaseout, or $241,950. [See Table 1] Since his income exceeds the threshold 
plus the phaseout range, none of his law practice income is QBI. Dino’s taxable income 
is:
Adjusted gross income$262,944
Standard deduction(14,600)
QBI deduction0
Income$248,344
In this case, the increase of $130,000 of gross income, when comparing Example 10 
and Example 9, created $148,726 of additional taxable income ($248,344 - 99,618) 
resulting from the loss of the QBI deduction.
TAXABLE INCOME EXCEEDS THRESHOLD BUT IS WITHIN PHASEOUT RANGE
When a person’s taxable income exceeds the threshold limit of $191,950 ($383,900 for married filing 
joint return,or $191,950 for married filing separate return)) but is within the phaseout range of $50,000 
($100,000 for married filing joint return), a portion of the income from a specified service business is QBI. 
To determine the percentage allowed as QBI, the taxpayer must back in from the amount disallowed. 
The amount disallowed is [Code Sec. 199A(d)(3)(B]:
(Taxable income less threshold)
(phaseout range)

INAPPLICABILITY OF W-2 WAGE OR QUALIFIED PROPERTY LIMITS
Qualifying trade or business income, other than that from specified service businesses, is subject to 
deduction limits based on W-2 wages, and basis of qualified property. These limits are subject to the 
same threshold and phaseout limits and the same partial allowances that apply to specified service 
business income. Therefore, these limits only apply when the taxable income is above the threshold but 
below the full phase-out.
OTHER TRADE OR BUSINESS RULES
U.S.  source  business  income  other  than  specified  service  business  income,  is  subject  to  the  QBI 
deduction even for taxpayers whose incomes exceed the threshold. However, there are some special 
limitations that affect this deduction, which are dependent upon the relationship of the taxpayer’s taxable 
income to the thresholds and phaseouts.

 435  •  Chapter 28: Section 199A Pass-Through Income Deduction
W-2 WAGE LIMITATION
A holdover rule from the now-repealed Domestic Production Activities Deduction is a limitation based on 
the W-2 wages paid by the business during the taxable year. In general, a taxpayer’s QBI deduction is 
limited to 50% of W-2 wages paid. [Code Sec. 199A(b)(2)(i)]
However, there are some exceptions to this rule. First, the limit does not apply to any taxpayer whose 
taxable income (before the Section 199A deduction) is less than the threshold amount. [Code Sec. 
199A(b)(3)(A)] The threshold and phase-ins are the same as those discussed above under specified 
service business income.
Moreover, a taxpayer with substantial depreciable property may qualify for the combined W-2 wage 
and property limitation. W-2 wages include any payment subject to either FICA or withholding. [Code 
Secs. 199A(b)(4)(A), 6051(a), 3401(a)] Thus, items included on Form W-2, such as health insurance 
for employees, including S corporation shareholder-employees, constitute part of the W-2 base. Wages 
paid in Puerto Rico also qualify as part of this base. [Code Sec. 199A(f )(1)(C)(ii)]
However, guaranteed payments to partners are not reported on Form W-2, but, rather, are reported on 
Form 1065, Schedule K-1. These payments are not part of the W-2 base. The W-2 wages are only those 
applicable to a qualified trade or business. [Code Sec. 199A(b)(4)(B)] Any wages allocable to foreign 
source income or to investment income that does not constitute trade or business income, would not be 
taken into account for this limit.
Moreover, the W-2 wages must be reported on a payroll tax return. This return, if not filed timely, must be 
filed no later than 60 days following the due date of the return. [Code Sec. 199A(b)(4)(C)]
LIMIT PER TRADE OR BUSINESS
This limitation applies to each separate trade or business. The grouping limitations discussed above 
may be important in this regard.
Example 12
Surpersoft,  Inc, an S corporation, sells  and installs specialized  computer  software. 
Surpersoft has a substantial payroll. Softmagic, LLC, is owned by the shareholders of 
Surpersoft, in equal proportions. Softmagic owns the intellectual property rights to the 
software sold by Surpersoft and receives royalties from Surpersoft on every copy of 
software it sells. Softmagic has no employees. All of the owners have taxable income in 
excess of the thresholds and phaseout ranges.
Since the two entities are functionally independent, in similar business lines and have 
identical ownership, the owners should be able to group income from both entities 
together and treat them as a unified business for purposes of the Section 199A deduction. 
Otherwise the income from Softmagic would not qualify for the deduction since it pays 
no W-2 wages.

 436  •  Chapter 28: Section 199A Pass-Through Income Deduction
TAXABLE INCOME EXCEEDS THRESHOLD PLUS PHASEOUT
When a person’s taxable income exceeds the threshold limit of $191,950 ($383,900 for married filing 
joint return) plus the phaseout range of $50,000 ($100,000 for married filing joint return), the W-2 wage 
limit applies in full.
Example 13
Bryce and Josephine file a joint return in 2024. Their combined income items are:

Bryce’s business reported $350,000 net income and paid $90,000 W-2 wages this year. Josephine’s 
net income was $400,000 and her business paid $1,300,000 in W-2 wages. They compute each QBI

 437  •  Chapter 28: Section 199A Pass-Through Income Deduction
WAGE AND PROPERTY LIMITATION
As  an  alternative  to  the  wage  limitation,  a  taxpayer  may  claim  a  limit  based  on  W-2  wages  plus  a 
percentage of basis of certain property. [Code Sec. 199A(b)(2)(ii)] The first component is 25 percent 
of the W-2 wage base. The second component is based on the unadjusted basis of certain qualified 
property held at the end of the year. [Code Sec. 199A(b)(6)] Qualified property has several requirements 
as described below:
• Only tangible and depreciable property qualifies (thus land and intangibles do not qualify); 
[Code Sec. 199A(b)(6)(A)]
• The  property  must  be  held  and  available  for  use  at  the  end  of  the  year;  [Code  Sec. 
199A(b)(6)(A)(i)]
• The property must have been used for production of QBI during the year; [Code Sec. 
199A(b)(6)(A)(ii)]
• The “depreciable period” of the property must not have ended at the close of the year; 
[Code Sec. 199A(b)(6)(A)(iii)]
• There are some special rules relating to the depreciable period, of property, as the term 
applies to Section 199A:
 ▫If the property’s MACRS life exceeds 10 years, the depreciable period is the 
last full year MACRS life;
 ▫For other property, the depreciable period is 10 years.
The MACRS life is determined without regard to any required or elected alternative depreciation system 
period. The period ends with the last year in which the holder may claim an entire year of depreciation. 
For nonresidential property, that year would be 39 years, since the mid-month convention applies to 
real estate. For nonresidential property with a 27½ year, it would be the 27th or 28th year of ownership, 
depending upon the time of year the property was originally placed in service. For qualified improvement 
property, subject to the half-year convention or mid-quarter convention, the depreciable period ends with 
the 15th year.
Example 14
Assume the same facts in Example 13 except that Bryce’s business holds $1,500,000 
of qualified property at the end of the year and Josephine’s business owns $1,000,000 
of qualified property (unadjusted basis in both cases). They would compute the QBI 
deductions as:

PHASE-IN OF W-2 AND QUALIFIED PROPERTY LIMITS
The limits concerning W-2 wages and qualified property do not apply to taxpayers whose taxable income 
does not exceed the threshold amount, described in Table 1. [Code Sec. 199A(b)(3)(B)] When taxable 
income exceeds the threshold, but is still within the phaseout range, the limits apply proportionately. 
[Code Sec. 199A(b)(3)(B)(i)]

 439  •  Chapter 28: Section 199A Pass-Through Income Deduction
Example 15
Assume the same facts in Example 14, except that Bryce and Josephine also incur a loss 
from an interest in a Mexican resort in which they materially participate. The loss is 
$400,000, which reduces their ordinary income from $50,000 to a loss of $350,000. 
Since this business is not located in the U.S., it has no effect on QBI, per se.
Their joint taxable income, before the Section 199A deduction is:
Ordinary income($350,000)
Capital gains & qualified dividends60,000
Qualified business income750,000
AGI460,000
Itemized deductions(70,000)
Taxable income before 199A deduction390,000
Since they file a joint return, their threshold is $383,900 and their phaseout range is 
$100,000. Their income is between the threshold and the end of the phaseout range, 
so they may claim deductions for a portion of QBI in excess of the W-2 or W-2 and 
qualified property limits.
Their  taxable  income  before  the  Section  199A  deduction  of  $390,000  exceeds 
their threshold amount of $383,900 by $6,100. This is 6.1% of the phaseout range. 
Accordingly, they can claim a Section 199A deduction for 93.9% (1-.061) of the amount 
by which the QBI exceeds the W-2 and property limits, in addition to the amount 
allowed by those limits. Their allowable Section 199A deduction, before considering 
the taxable income limitation, is:

EFFECT OF QUALIFIED BUSINESS LOSS
The effect of a loss from a qualified business is to offset income from other qualified businesses. If 
the  overall  QBI  is  still  positive,  it  reduces  the  QBI  from  each  other  business  proportionately.  [Reg. 
§1.199A-1(d)(2)(iii)(A)] If the overall QBI is negative, the result is a carryforward, which offsets QBI 
deductions in future years. [Reg. §1.199A-1(d)(2)(iii)(B)]

 441  •  Chapter 28: Section 199A Pass-Through Income Deduction
Example 16
Assume the same facts in Example 15 except that the resort was in Puerto Rico, rather 
than Mexico. This loss is an item of negative QBI since any business in Puerto Rico is a 
U.S. business for purposes of QBI. Their joint taxable income, before the Section 199A 
deduction is unchanged in total, but the composition is different.

RULES FOR S CORPORATIONS AND PARTNERSHIPS
When the entity that actually conducts the business is not an individual, there are some special rules that 
apply. If the entity is a C corporation, there is no Section 199A deduction. If the entity is a partnership or 
S corporation, the deduction is claimed by the owners. [Code Sec. 199A(f )(1)(A)(i)]
In  order  for  the  partners  or  shareholders  to  calculate  their  QBI  deductions,  the  partnership  or  S 
corporation must report the appropriate income and other items to each owner. The information needed 
is each partner or shareholder’s portion of the necessary variables: [Code Sec. 199A(f)(1)(A)(ii)]

 444  •  Chapter 28: Section 199A Pass-Through Income Deduction
• Qualifying income and loss items from the qualifying business;
• W-2 wages paid by the qualifying business; and
• Qualified property owned by the business at the end of the taxable year.
PARTNERSHIPS
If the entity is a partnership, each partner receives a share of W-2 wages according to his or her share of 
partnership wage expense. [Code Sec. 199A(f)(1)(A)] If the partnership makes no special allocations of 
wage expense, this percentage will be the same as the partner’s share of partnership income.
The partnership must allocate UBIA in accordance with its allocation of depreciation to the partners on 
the last day of the partnership’s taxable year. [Reg. §1.199A-2(a)(3)(ii)] There is no allocation of UBIA 
to any person who has completely disposed of his or her partnership interest before the end of the 
partnership’s taxable year.
Example 19
The Definer Partnership has four partners, David, Ellen, Floyd and Irene. David, the 
general partner, has an interest in 25% of the profits other than depreciation. David has 
a 10% share of partnership depreciation. The other three members each have a 25% 
interest in partnership income, except for depreciation and 30% of the depreciation 
deductions. In 2024, the partnership reports the following:
Interest income$60,000
Rent income250,000
W-2 wages to employees(30,000)
Net rent before depreciation220,000
Depreciation(120,000)
Net rental income100,000
Net income overall$160,000
The partnership owns depreciable property with an unadjusted basis of $2,400,000 at 
year end. None of this property’s depreciable period has expired.
The interest income is reported separately as portfolio income and does not become 
part of qualified business income. Each of the four partners receives $15,000 of interest 
income on Schedule K-1. The rent income is a bit more complicated.
The partners will be allocated the following:

S CORPORATIONS
When  the  entity  is  an  S  corporation,  there  will  be  no  special  allocations  of  any  line  item,  such  as 
depreciation. Therefore, if there are no changes in shareholdings during a taxable year, the qualifying 
income, W-2 wages, and qualified property limits will all be allocated per-share per day. However, if 
there is a complete termination of a shareholder’s interest in the corporation, a substantial disposition of 
stock or a substantial issuance of new stock, there may be a split year. In this case, the corporation must 
allocate the income and W-2 wage information to each shareholder based on the income in each part of 
the year. 
The S corporation must allocate UBIA in proportion to the outstanding shares on the last day of the 
corporation’s taxable year. [Reg. §1.199A-2(a)(3)(iii)] There is no allocation of UBIA to any person who 
has disposed of all of his or her stock before the end of the corporation’s taxable year.

As of December 31, Hamlet has $2,420,000 unadjusted basis of qualified property. 
All of it had been used for production of qualified business income and none of this 
property was older than its depreciable period.
Hamlet’s default allocation among the three shareholders is the weighted average per 
share per day method. [Code Sec. 1377(a)(1)] These pro-rata allocations will be:

Based on these allocations, each shareholder computes the appropriate Section 199A 
deduction, assuming that each is above the applicable taxable income threshold, and 
each has sufficient taxable income to support the deduction. For all of the items except 
UBIA, the corporation must allocate among the three shareholders on a per-share per-
day formula. However, the corporation must allocate UBIA among the shareholders 
in proportion to the shares held on the last day of the year. In this case, Linda holds 
50% and Mel holds 50%. The shareholders would each compute their Section 199A 
deductions as follows:

Since Linda did not exchange any shares during the year, her allocation using the 
interim closing method is the same as the pro-rata, and her Section 199A deduction is 
the combined W-2 wage and qualified property limit. However, Ken, who is allocated 
no UBIA for the year, uses the 50% of W-2 wage limit for his deduction. Mel, like Linda, 
has a slight advantage from the combined W-2 wage and qualified property limit.

 448  •  Chapter 28: Section 199A Pass-Through Income Deduction
APPLICATION TO COOPERATIVES AND PATRONS
Code Section 199A, after amendment by the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, provides 
a special deduction for agricultural and horticultural cooperatives. In general, the deduction follows the 
rules for the Domestic Production Activities Deduction, prior to its repeal by the TCJA. The cooperative 
is allowed a deduction for 9% of its qualified production activities income of the year, or taxable income, 
whichever is less. [Code Sec. 199A(g)(1)(A)] The deduction is limited to 50% of the W-2 wages paid in 
connection with domestic production activities gross receipts. [Code Sec. 199A(g)(1)(B)]
Taxable dividends from cooperatives also qualify for the deduction by the patrons. However, the patron 
may be required to reduce the 20% deduction. As with the former DPAD, cooperatives may pass through 
a portion of this Code Section 199A(g) deduction to their patrons. Whether or not the cooperative passes 
through this deduction, a patron must reduce the QBI deduction attributable to patronage income by the 
lesser of 9% of the patron’s income attributable to patronage income or 50% of wages paid by the patron 
in connection with the business that earned the income from the cooperative. [Code Sec. 199A(b)(7)]
EFFECT ON PARTNER OR SHAREHOLDER BASIS
The qualified business income passes through from the partnership or S corporation to the owner. Under 
the general basis rules, this income increases the owner’s basis, thus making it available for tax-free 
distributions of cash, or deduction of future losses, or losses of a different character in the same year. 
However, the QBI deduction, computed at the owner level, does not affect basis in the partner’s interest 
in the partnership or the shareholder’s stock or debt basis.
Example 21
James and Meaghan are the two equal and only members in JAM, LLC. In 2024, 
JAM reports $200,000 of QBI, and $18,000 of cash charitable contributions. JAM 
distributes $50,000 to each member. James itemizes his deductions and Meaghan uses 
the standard deduction. Both are able to claim the Section 199A deduction in full.
The effects on each member’s basis and taxable income are:

 449  •  Chapter 28: Section 199A Pass-Through Income Deduction
Comment
Although the statutory language on the effect of losses on the Section 199A deduction 
is scant, it seems almost certain that a loss would actually need to be allowable, and not 
blocked by the basis at-risk or passive activity limitations to result in a negative QBI 
amount.
Example 22
Evelyn is a shareholder in Evico, an S corporation. In 2024, her share of Evico’s ordinary 
loss is $60,000. Evico’s business qualifies for the Section 199A deduction. She has no 
other sources of QBI in 2024. Her basis in Evico stock is $40,000 and she has no debt 
basis in Evico. The amount she can potentially deduct on her 2024 income tax return is 
$40,000, and she must carry $20,000 of the loss forward to 2025. [Code Sec. 1366(d)
(2)]
She must carry $40,000 forward to offset QBI in 2025 and future years, whether or not 
she is ever allowed to deduct the $20,000 loss in excess of basis. The $20,000 loss in 
excess of her basis has no effects on QBI until she can claim it on a return.
However, a loss carried forward from a year that began before 2018 does not affect QBI. The loss 
disallowance can be from basis, amount at risk, the passive activity loss limits, or a net operating loss. 
[Reg. §1.199A-3(b)(1)(iv)]
ACCURACY-RELATED PENALTIES ON UNDERPAYMENTS
Among the penalties of underpayment, or late payment of tax, is the Section 6662 penalty imposed 
in cases of negligence, disregard of rules, or “substantial understatement” of income tax. [Code Sec. 
6662(b)] The penalty is 20 percent of the offending amount of understatement. [Code Sec. 6662(a)]
In general, a substantial understatement exists when the understatement exceeds the greater of $5,000 
or 10 percent of the correct tax for the year. [Code Sec. 6662(d)(1)(A)] However, for any taxpayer claiming 
the Section 199A deduction, the 10 percent threshold is reduced to 5 percent. [Code Sec. 6662(d)(1)(C)]
Comment
The reduction of the underpayment threshold applies to any taxpayer claiming the 
Section 199A deduction. The understatement need not be caused by the deduction, but 
could be related to any overstated deduction or understated income.

 450  •  Chapter 28: Section 199A Pass-Through Income Deduction
EFFECT OF QBI DEDUCTION ON OTHER TAXES
In addition to the income tax, partners and shareholders may be subject to other taxes as a result of 
income from the pass-through entity. The most important federal taxes, in addition to the income tax, are:
• The alternative minimum tax;
• The self-employment tax; and
• The net investment income tax.
Section 199A specifically states that the deduction is limited to “this chapter.” To understand the scope, 
Section 199A is contained in:
CHAPTER 1: NORMAL TAXES AND SURTAXES [Secs. 1—1400Z-2]
Thus,  it  only  applies  to  taxes  imposed  on  noncorporate  taxpayers  within  these  sections.  The  most 
important of these are the regular income tax (Section 1) and the alternative minimum tax (Section 55). 
Although the alternative minimum tax requires recalculation of several items of income and deductions, 
there is no second calculation of the QBI deduction for purposes of the alternative minimum tax. [Code 
Sec. 199A(f )(2)] 
The self-employment tax rules appear in Chapter 2:
TAX ON SELF-EMPLOYMENT INCOME.
The net investment income tax rules are in Chapter 3:
UNEARNED INCOME MEDICARE CONTRIBUTION.
Therefore, the QBI deduction cannot reduce either of these taxes.
II. ¶4.02 ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX
Although  the  House  version  of  the  TCJA  would  have  repealed  the  alternative minimum tax, the final 
version  did  not  go  this  far.  The  Act  repealed  the  corporate  alternative minimum tax, with a provision 
allowing the taxpayer to claim the alternative minimum tax credit between 2018 and 2021. [Code Sec. 
53(c)]
The final version of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 did not repeal the alternative  minimum  tax  for  
individuals. However, it substantially raised the exemption and phaseout. The 2024 exemptions and 
phaseouts are:

 451  •  Chapter 28: Section 199A Pass-Through Income Deduction
2024
Exemption, married joint$133,300
Exemption, single or head of household    85,700
Exemption, married filing separate    66,650
Exemption, estate or trust    29,900
Exemption phaseout begins, married joint1,218,700
Exemption phaseout begins, single or head of household   609,350
Exemption phaseout begins, married filing separate   609,350
Exemption phaseout begins, estate or trust     99,700
* Rev. Proc. 2018-57, 2018-49 IRB 827 §3.12
Pass-through  entities  must  continue  to  report  tax  preferences  and  adjustments  to  their  partners  and  
shareholders. C corporations will need to determine their tentative alternative minimum tax for purposes 
of the alternative minimum tax credit. Individuals, estates and trusts will still need to determine tentative 
alternative minimum tax, although the imposition of the alternative minimum tax will undoubtedly apply in 
greatly reduced numbers.
III. ¶4.03 REPATRIATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS
The  United  States  has  historically  taxed  its  citizens  and  domestic  corporations  on  their  worldwide  
incomes. To  alleviate  the  problems  of  multiple  taxes  on  one  income  stream,  the  United  States  has 
offered a foreign tax credit.
Beginning in 2018, the U.S. approach shifted toward a territorial system, whereby domestic corporations 
are allowed to claim a deduction for dividends received attributable to foreign source income. [Code 
Sec. 245A] This deduction applies only to C corporations.
As  part  of  the  transition  to  the  territorial  system,  there  is  a  deemed  repatriation  of  deferred  foreign 
income for certain U.S. shareholders of foreign corporations. [Code Sec. 965] Under this rule, the U.S. 
shareholder must include in its income its share of undistributed foreign income from corporations in 
which it owns at least 10 percent of the stock. In some cases, a U.S. shareholder can be a partnership 
or S corporation. Since partnerships and S corporations are pass-through entities, the repatriation tax 
applies at the partner or shareholder level. There are certain reduced tax rates, depending upon the U.S. 
shareholder’s portion of the cash, cash equivalents and noncash assets held abroad.
I V.  ¶4.04 CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS AND FOREIGN TAXES
One of the areas where there was a divergence between partnerships and S corporations was the 
relationship of charitable contributions and foreign taxes to shareholder basis. Since 1983, the Code has 
treated charitable contributions and foreign income taxes as items that are limited by shareholder basis 
[Code Sec. 1366(a)(1), flush language]

 452  •  Chapter 28: Section 199A Pass-Through Income Deduction
Example 23
Sharon and Barbara each own 50% of the stock in Sharbar, Inc., an S corporation. For 
2017, the corporation sustained an ordinary loss of $80,000 and made qualifying cash 
contributions of $20,000. Neither shareholder received any distribution.
Sharon had basis of $60,000 at the beginning of 2017. She claims a deduction for 
$40,000 of ordinary loss and $10,000 of charitable contributions. She must reduce 
her basis by $50,000.
Barbara had no basis at the beginning of 2017. She would not be allowed any deduction 
for either the ordinary loss or the charitable contributions. Her basis would remain at 
zero.
In  contrast,  charitable  contributions  made  by  the  partnership  and foreign  income  taxes  paid  by  the 
partnership had not been subject to the partner basis limit for deductibility. [Code Secs. 702(a)(4), 702(a)
(6), 703(a)(2)(B), 703(a) (2)(C), Reg. § 1.704-1(d)(2); Ltr. Rul. 8405084]
Example 24
If Sharbar, from Example 23 had been a partnership, Sharon’s deductible amounts 
would have been the same. However, Barbara, who had no basis in her partnership 
interest, would be able to claim her $10,000 charitable contribution. She would not 
have been allowed to deduct her share of ordinary loss and would have carried that 
amount forward. However, the charitable contribution would not reduce her basis in 
her partnership interest in 2017 or in any future year.
The TCJA removed this distinction. For taxable years beginning after 2017, both charitable contributions 
and foreign income tax of partnerships are now subject to the same limits as other losses. [Code Sec. 
704(d)(3)(A)]
Example 25
Assume the same facts in Example 24 except that in the year 2024 Barbara would not 
be able to deduct any of the charitable contribution. She would need to carry it forward 
along with the ordinary loss from the year. Her total carryforward to 2025 would be:
Ordinary loss$40,000
Charitable contributions10,000
Total$50,000
Assume that her share of income in 2025 was $30,000. She would be allowed to claim 
60% ($30,000/$50,000) of each of the carryforwards on her 2025 tax return.

 453  •  Chapter 28: Section 199A Pass-Through Income Deduction
This rule does not apply to the excess of fair market value over the partnership’s adjusted basis of capital 
gain property contributed to a qualifying organization. [Code Sec. 704(d)(3)(B), Conference Report to 
Accompany H.R. 1, December 15, 2017, p. 515] This also conforms to the treatment of S corporations 
and shareholders.
Example 26
Assume the same facts in Example 25, except that the contribution had been capital 
gain property with a FMV of $60,000 and adjusted basis of $20,000. Sharon and 
Barbara would each be allocated $30,000 of fair market value and $10,000 of basis in 
the contributed property. In 2024, Sharon would be able to claim a $30,000 charitable 
deduction and would only reduce her basis in her partnership interest by her allocated 
$10,000 of partnership basis of contributed property. Barbara would not be able to 
claim a $20,000 deduction in 2024 for her allocated basis in the contributed property 
but would be able to claim a 2024 deduction for her share of the contributed property’s 
unrealized appreciation.
V.   ¶4.05 TAXES PAID ON INCOME FROM PASS-THROUGH ENTITIES
Before 2018, individuals were allowed to claim itemized deductions for state, local and foreign income 
taxes assessed on their taxable income, including income from partnerships and S corporations. [Code 
Sec. 164(a)(3)] This deduction was subject to an add-back adjustment for purposes of the alternative 
minimum tax. [Code Sec. 56(b)(1)(A)(ii)]
At least one attempt to treat state income tax imposed on S corporation income as a trade or business, 
“above  the  line”  deduction  was  unsuccessful.  [Cutler  v.  Comm’r,  TC  Memo  2015-73]  Therefore  the 
proper treatment of state, local and foreign income tax imposed on an individual is that of an itemized 
deduction.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 limits the deduction for all taxes allowed as itemized deductions to 
$10,000 per year. [Code Sec. 164(b)(6)] The legislative history indicates that the only exception is a 
business tax that is treated as an above the line deduction on Schedule C, Schedule E or Schedule F. 
[Conference Report to Accompany H.R. 1, December 15, 2017, p. 260]

PART SIX: FIGURING YOUR TAXES AND CREDITS
The nine chapters in this part explain how to figure your tax and how to figure the tax of certain children 
who have unearned income. They also discuss tax credits that, unlike deductions, are subtracted directly 
from your tax and reduce your tax, dollar for dollar. Chapter 35 discusses the earned  income  credit.  
Chapter 37 discusses a wide variety of other credits, such as the adoption credit.

 459  •  Chapter 29: How to Figure Your Tax
CHAPTER 29: HOW TO FIGURE YOUR TAX
Chapter Objective
After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• Recognize various alternative minimum tax adjustments and preference items.
I.   INTRODUCTION
After you have figured your income and deductions as explained in Parts One through Five, your next 
step is to figure your tax. This chapter discusses:
• The general steps you take to figure your tax, and
• An additional tax you may have to pay called the alternative minimum tax (AMT).
II. FIGURING YOUR TAX 
Your income tax is based on your taxable income. After you figure your income tax and any alternative 
minimum tax, subtract your tax credits and add any other taxes you may owe. The result is your total 
tax. Compare your total tax with your total payments to determine whether you are entitled to a refund or 
must make a payment. 
This section provides a general outline of how to figure your tax. 
Tax. Most taxpayers use either the Tax Table or the Tax Computation Worksheet to figure their income 
tax. However, there are special methods if your income includes any of the following items. 
• A net capital gain (see chapter 16).
• Qualified dividends taxed at the same rates as a net capital gain (see chapters 8 and 16).
• Lump-sum distributions (see chapter 10). 
• Farming and fishing income (see Schedule J (Form 1040). 
• Tax for certain children who have unearned income (see chapter 30).
• Parents’ election to report child’s interest and dividends (see chapter 30).
• Foreign earned income exclusion or the housing exclusion.

 460  •  Chapter 29: How to Figure Your Tax
Credits. After you figure your income tax and any alternative minimum tax (discussed later), determine if 
you are eligible for any tax credits. Eligibility information for these tax credits is discussed in chapters 31 
through 37 and your form instructions. 
III. ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX 
This section briefly discusses an additional tax you may have to pay.
The tax law gives special treatment to some kinds of income and allows special deductions and credits 
for some kinds of expenses. Taxpayers who benefit from the law in these ways may have to pay at least 
a minimum amount of tax through an additional tax. This additional tax is called the alternative minimum 
tax (AMT). 
In 2024, you may have to pay the alternative minimum tax if your taxable income for regular tax purposes, 
combined with certain adjustments and tax preference items, is more than:
• $133,300 if your filing status is married filing joint (or qualifying surviving spouse),
• $85,700 if your filing status is single or head of household, or
• $66,650 if your filing status is married filing separate.
These amounts will be indexed annually for inflation.
Adjustments  and  tax  preference  items.  The  more  common  adjustments  and  tax  preference  items  
include:
• Addition of standard deduction (if claimed),
• Addition of itemized deductions claimed for state and local taxes and certain interest,
• Subtraction of any refund of state and local taxes included in gross income, 
• Changes to accelerated depreciation of certain property, 
• Difference between gain or loss on the sale of property reported for regular tax purposes 
and AMT purposes, 
• Addition of certain income from incentive stock options, 
• Change in certain passive activity loss deductions, 
• Addition of certain depletion that is more than the adjusted basis of the property, 
• Addition of part of the deduction for certain intangible drilling costs, and 
• Addition of tax-exempt interest on certain private activity bonds.

CHAPTER 30: TAX ON UNEARNED 
INCOME OF CERTAIN CHILDREN
Chapter Objective
After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• Recall the rules related to the tax on unearned income of certain children.
I.   INTRODUCTION 
This chapter discusses the following two rules that may affect the tax on unearned income of certain 
children.
1. If the child’s interest and dividend income (including capital gain distributions) total less 
than $13,000, the child’s parent may be able to choose to include that income on the 
parent’s return rather than file a return for the child. 
2. If the child’s interest, dividends, and other unearned income total more than $2,600, the 
child’s income is taxed at special tax rates.
For these rules, the term “child” includes a legally adopted child and a stepchild. These rules apply 
whether or not the child is a dependent. These rules do not apply if neither of the child’s parents were 
living at the end of the year.
II. PARENT’S   ELECTION   TO   REPORT   CHILD’S   INTEREST   AND   
DIVIDENDS
You may be able to elect to include your child’s interest and dividend income (including capital gain 
distributions) on your tax return. If you do, your child will not have to file a return.
You can make this election only if all the following conditions are met.
• Your child was under age 19 (or under age 24 if a full-time student) at the end of the year.
• Your child had income only from interest and dividends (including capital gain distributions 
and Alaska Permanent Fund dividends).
• The child’s gross income was less than $13,000.
• The child is required to file a return unless you make this election.
• The child does not file a joint return for the year.

 464  •  Chapter 30: Tax on Unearned Income of Certain Children
• No estimated tax payment was made for the year, and no overpayment from the previous 
year (or from any amended return) was applied to this year under your child’s name and 
SSN.
• No federal income tax was taken out of your child’s income under the backup withholding 
rules.
• You are the parent whose return must be used when applying the special tax rules for 
children.
How to make the election. Make the election by attaching Form 8814 to your Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 
1040-NR. Attach a separate Form 8814 for each child for whom you make the election. You can make 
the election for one or more children and not for others.
EFFECT OF MAKING THE ELECTION
The federal income tax on your child’s income may be more if you make the Form 8814 election.
Rate may be higher. If your child received qualified dividends or capital gain distributions, you may pay 
up to $130 more tax if you make this election instead of filing a separate tax return for the child. This is 
because the tax rate on the child’s income between $1,300 and $2,600 is 10% if you make this election. 
However, if you file a separate return for the child, the tax rate may be as low as 0% because of the 
preferential tax rates for qualified dividends and capital gain distributions.
Deductions you cannot take. By making the Form 8814 election, you cannot take any of the following 
deductions that the child would be entitled to on his or her return.
• The additional standard deduction if the child is blind.
• The deduction for a penalty on an early withdrawal of your child’s savings.
• Itemized  deductions  (such  as  your  child’s  investment  interest  expenses  or  charitable 
contributions).
Alternative minimum tax (AMT). If your child received tax-exempt interest (or exempt-interest dividends 
paid by a regulated investment company) from certain private activity bonds, you must determine if 
that interest is a tax preference item for AMT purposes. If it is, you must include it with your own tax 
preference items when figuring your AMT. 
Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT). When figuring any NIIT on Form 8960, the amount on line 12 of Form 
8814 (other than Alaska Permanent Fund dividends) will increase the amount of your net investment 
income reported on Form 8960. 
Reduced  deductions  or  credits. If you use Form 8814, your increased adjusted gross income may 
reduce certain deductions or credits on your return including the following.
• Deduction for contributions to a traditional individual retirement arrangement (IRA).
• Deduction for student loan interest.

 465  •  Chapter 30: Tax on Unearned Income of Certain Children
• Itemized deductions for medical expenses and casualty and theft losses.
• Credit for child and dependent care expenses.
• Child tax credit.
• Education tax credits.
• Earned income credit.
Penalty  for  underpayment  of  estimated  tax. If you make this election for 2024 and did not have 
enough tax withheld or pay enough estimated tax to cover the tax you owe, you may be subject to a 
penalty. If you plan to make this election for 2025, you may need to increase your federal income tax 
withholding or your estimated tax payments to avoid the penalty. 
III. TAX FOR CERTAIN CHILDREN WHO HAVE UNEARNED INCOME
Special tax rates apply to certain dependent children with unearned income of $2,600 or more. If the 
child’s income is $2,600, you may be able to file Form 8615 to figure the tax. If the parent does not or 
cannot choose to include the child’s income on the parent’s return, use Form 8615 to figure the child’s 
tax. Attach the completed form to the child’s Form 1040 or 1040-NR.
WHEN FORM 8615 MUST BE FILED
Form 8615 must be filed for a child if all of the following statements are true:
1. The child’s unearned income was more than $2,600.
2. The child is required to file a return for 2024.
3. The child either:
a) Was under age 18 at the end of the year,
b) Was age 18 at the end of the year and did not have earned income that was 
more than half of his or her support, or
c) Was a full-time student at least age 19 and under age 24 at the end of 2024 
and did not have earned income that was more than half of his or her support.
4. At least one of the child’s parents was alive at the end of 2024.
5. The child does not file a joint return for 2024.
EARNED INCOME
Earned  income  includes  salaries,  wages,  tips,  professional  fees,  and  other  compensation  received 
for personal services performed. It also includes any amount received as a scholarship that you must 
include in income.

 466  •  Chapter 30: Tax on Unearned Income of Certain Children
Unearned Income Defined. Unearned income is generally all income other than salaries, wages, and 
other amounts received as pay for work actually done. It includes taxable interest, dividends, capital 
gains, unemployment compensation, taxable scholarship and fellowship grants not reported on Form 
W-2, the taxable part of social security and pension payments, and certain distributions from trusts. 
Unearned income includes amounts produced by assets the child obtained with earned income (such as 
interest on a savings account into which the child deposited wages).
Nontaxable income. For this purpose, unearned income includes only amounts the child must include 
in total income. Nontaxable unearned income, such as tax-exempt interest and the nontaxable part of 
social security and pension payments, is not included.
Income from property received as a gift. A child’s unearned income includes all income produced by 
property belonging to the child. This is true even if the property was transferred to the child, regardless of 
when the property was transferred or purchased or who transferred it.
A  child’s  unearned  income  includes  income  produced  by  property  given  as  a  gift  to  the  child. This 
includes gifts to the child from grandparents or any other person and gifts made under the Uniform Gift 
to Minors Act.
Trust Income. If a child is the beneficiary of a trust, distributions of taxable interest, dividends, capital 
gains, and other unearned income from the trust are unearned income to the child.
However, for purposes of completing Form 8615, a taxable distribution from a qualified disability trust is 
considered earned income, not unearned income.
SUPPORT
Your  child’s  support  includes  all  amounts  spent  to  provide  the  child  with  food,  lodging,  clothing, 
education, medical and dental care, recreation, transportation, and similar necessities. To figure your 
child’s support, count support provided by you, your child, and others. However, a scholarship received 
by your child is not considered support if your child is a full-time student.
ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX
A child may be subject to alternative minimum tax (AMT) if he or she has certain items given preferential 
treatment under the tax law.
NET INVESTMENT INCOME TAX
A child whose tax is figured on Form 8615 may be subject to the Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT). NIIT 
is a 3.8% tax on the lesser of the net investment income or the excess of the child’s modified adjusted 
gross income (MAGI) over the threshold amount.

 469  •  Chapter 31: Child and Dependent Care Credit
CHAPTER 31: CHILD AND DEPENDENT  
CARE CREDIT
Chapter Objective
After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• Recall how to figure the child and dependent care credit.
I.   INTRODUCTION 
This chapter discusses the credit for child and dependent care expenses and covers the following topics. 
• Tests you must meet to claim the credit. 
• How to figure the credit. 
• How to claim the credit. 
• Employment taxes you may have to pay as a household employer. 
You may be able to claim the credit if you pay someone to care for your dependent who is under age 13 
or for your spouse or dependent who is not able to care for himself or herself. The credit can be up to 
35% of your expenses. To qualify, you must pay these expenses so you can work or look for work.
Dependent care benefits. If you received any dependent care benefits from your employer during the 
year, you may be able to exclude from your income all or part of them. You must complete Part III of 
Form 2441 before you can figure the amount of your credit. 
II. TESTS TO CLAIM THE CREDIT 
To be able to claim the credit for child and dependent care expenses, you must file Form 1040, 1040-SR, 
or 1040-NR, and meet all the following tests.
1. The care must be for one or more qualifying persons who are identified on Form 2441. 
(See Qualifying Person Test.) 
2. You (and your spouse if filing jointly) must have earned income during the year. (However, 
see Rule  for  student-spouse  or  spouse  not  able  to  care  for  self  under  Earned  Income  
Test, later.)
3. You must pay child and dependent care expenses so you (and your spouse if filing jointly) 
can work or look for work. (See Work-Related Expense Test, later.)

 470  •  Chapter 31: Child and Dependent Care Credit
4. You must make payments for child and dependent care to someone you (or your spouse) 
cannot claim as a dependent. If you make payments to your child, he or she cannot be 
your dependent and must be age 19 or older by the end of the year. You cannot make 
payments to:
a) Your spouse, or 
b) The  parent  of  your  qualifying  person  if  your  qualifying  person  is  your  child  
and under age 13.
(See Payments to Relatives or Dependents under Work-Related Expense Test, later.)
5. Your filing  status  must  be  single,  head  of  household,  or  qualifying  widow(er)  with 
dependent  child. You  must  file  a  joint  return  if  you  are  married,  unless  an  exception 
applies to you. (See Joint Return Test, later.) 
6. You must identify the care provider on your tax return. (See Care Provider Identification 
Test, later.)
7. If you exclude or deduct dependent care benefits provided by a dependent care benefits 
plan,  the  total  amount  you  exclude  or  deduct  must  be  less  than  the  dollar  limit  for 
qualifying expenses (generally, $3,000 if one qualifying person was cared for or $6,000 if 
two or more qualifying persons were cared for).  
These tests are presented in Figure 31-A and are also explained in detail in this chapter.

 471  •  Chapter 31: Child and Dependent Care Credit
FIGURE 31-A. CAN YOU CLAIM THE CREDIT?
1. This also applies to your spouse, unless your spouse was disabled or a full-time student.
2. If you had expenses that met the requirements for 2023, except that you did not pay them until 2024, you may be able to 
claim those expenses in 2024. See Expenses not paid until the following year under How to Figure the Credit.

 472  •  Chapter 31: Child and Dependent Care Credit
QUALIFYING PERSON TEST 
Your child and dependent care expenses must be for the care of one or more qualifying persons. 
A qualifying person is:  
1. Your qualifying child who is your dependent and who was under age 13 when the care 
was provided,
2. Your spouse who was physically or mentally not able to care for himself or herself and 
lived with you more than half the year, or 
3. A person who was physically or mentally not able to care for himself or herself, lived with 
you for more than half the year, and either:
a) Was your dependent, or
b) Would have been your dependent except that (i) he or she received gross 
income greater than the threshold, (ii) he or she filed a joint return, or (iii) you, 
or your spouse if filing jointly, could be claimed as a dependent on someone 
else’s 2024 return.
If you are divorced or separated, see Child of Divorced or Separated Parents, later, to determine which 
parent may treat the child as a qualifying person. 
Person qualifying for part of year. You determine a person’s qualifying status each day. For example, 
if the person for whom you pay child and dependent care expenses no longer qualifies on September 
16, count only those expenses through September 15. Also see Dollar Limit under How To Figure the 
Credit, later. 
Taxpayer identification number. You must include on your return the name and taxpayer identification 
number (generally the social security number) of the qualifying person(s). If the correct information is not 
shown, the credit may be reduced or disallowed. 
Individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN) for aliens. If your qualifying person is a nonresident 
or resident alien who does not have and cannot get a social security number (SSN), use that person’s 
ITIN. To apply for an ITIN, file Form W-7 with the IRS. The ITIN is entered wherever an SSN is requested 
on a tax return. 
An ITIN is for tax use only. It does not entitle the holder to social security benefits or change the holder’s 
employment or immigration status under U.S. law. 
Adoption taxpayer identification number (ATIN). If your qualifying person is a child who was placed in 
your home for adoption and for whom you do not have an SSN, you must get an ATIN for the child. File 
Form W-7A, Application for Taxpayer Identification Number for Pending U.S. Adoptions. 
Child of Divorced or Separated Parents. Even if you cannot claim your child as a dependent, he or 
she is treated as your qualifying person if:

 473  •  Chapter 31: Child and Dependent Care Credit
• The child was under age 13 or was not physically or mentally able to care for himself or 
herself,
• The  child  received  over  half  of  his  or  her  support  during  the  calendar  year  from  one  or  
both parents who are divorced or legally separated under a decree of divorce or separate 
maintenance, are separated under a written separation agreement, or lived apart at all 
times during the last six months of the calendar year,
• The child was in the custody of one or both parents for more than half the year, and 
• You were the child’s custodial parent.
The custodial parent is the parent with whom the child lived for the greater number of nights in 2023. If 
the child was with each parent for an equal number of nights, the custodial parent is the parent with the 
higher adjusted gross income.
The  noncustodial  parent  cannot  treat  the  child  as  a  qualifying  person  even  if  that  parent  is  entitled  to  
claim the child as a dependent under the special rule for a child of divorced or separated parents.
EARNED INCOME TEST 
To claim the credit, you (and your spouse if filing jointly) must have earned income during the year. 
Earned income. Earned income includes wages, salaries, tips, other taxable employee compensation, 
and  net  earnings  from  self-employment.  A  net  loss  from  self-employment  reduces  earned  income.  
Earned income also includes strike benefits and any disability pay you report as wages. 
Generally, only taxable compensation is included. However, you can elect to include nontaxable combat 
pay in earned income. If you are filing a joint return and both you and your spouse received nontaxable 
combat pay, you can each make your own election. (In other words, if one of you makes the election, the 
other one can also make it but does not have to.) You should figure your credit both ways and make the 
election if it gives you a greater tax benefit.
Members of certain religious faiths opposed to social security. Certain income earned by persons 
who are members of certain religious faiths that are opposed to participation in Social Security Act 
programs  and  have  an  IRS-approved  form  that  exempts  certain  income  from  social  security  and  
Medicare taxes may not be considered earned income for this purpose. 
Not earned income. Earned income does not include:
• Pensions and annuities,
• Amounts reported on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 1 excluded as foreign earned income 
on Form 2555, line 43,
• Social security and railroad retirement benefits,
• Workers’ compensation,

 474  •  Chapter 31: Child and Dependent Care Credit
• Interest and dividends,
• Unemployment compensation,
• Scholarship or fellowship grants, except for those reported on a Form W-2 and paid to 
you for teaching or other services,
• Nontaxable workfare payments,
• Child support payments received,
• Income  of  nonresident  aliens  that  is  not  effectively  connected  with  a  U.S.  trade  or 
business, or
• Any amount received for work while an inmate in a penal institution.
Rule for student-spouse or spouse not able to care for self. Your spouse is treated as having earned 
income for any month that he or she is:  
1. A full-time student, or 
2. Physically or mentally not able to care for himself or herself. (Your spouse also must live 
with you for more than half the year.)  
If you are filing a joint return, this rule also applies to you. You can be treated as having earned income 
for any month you are a full-time student or not able to care for yourself.
Figure the earned income of the nonworking spouse described under (1) or (2) above as explained 
under Earned Income Limit, later. 
This rule applies to only one spouse for any one month. If, in the same month, both you and your spouse 
do not work and are either full-time students or physically or mentally not able to care for yourselves, 
only one of you can be treated as having earned income in that month. 
Full-time student. You are a full-time student if you are enrolled at and attend a school for the number 
of hours or classes that the school considers full time. You must have been a student for some part of 
each of 5 calendar months during the year. (The months need not be consecutive.) 
School. The  term  “school”  includes  high  schools,  colleges,  universities,  and  technical,  trade,  and 
mechanical schools. It does not include on-the-job training courses, correspondence schools, or school 
offering courses only through the Internet. 
WORK-RELATED EXPENSE TEST 
Child  and  dependent  care  expenses  must  be  work-related  to  qualify  for  the  credit.  Expenses  are 
considered work related only if both of the following are true. 
• They allow you (and your spouse if you are married) to work or look for work. 
• They are for a qualifying person’s care. 

 475  •  Chapter 31: Child and Dependent Care Credit
Working or Looking for Work 
To be work-related, your expenses must allow you to work or look for work. If you are married, generally 
both you and your spouse must work or look for work. Your spouse is treated as working during any 
month he or she is a full-time student or is physically or mentally not able to care for himself or herself. 
Your work can be for others or in your own business or partnership. It can be either full time or part time. 
Work also includes actively looking for work. However, if you do not find a job and have no earned 
income for the year, you cannot take this credit. See Earned Income Test, earlier. 
An expense is not considered work-related merely because you had it while you were working. The 
purpose of the expense must be to enable you to work. Whether your expenses allow you to work or 
look for work depends on the facts. 
Volunteer work. For this purpose, you are not considered to be working if you do unpaid volunteer work 
or volunteer work for a nominal salary. 
Work for part of year. If you work or actively look for work during only part of the period covered by the 
expenses, then you must figure your expenses for each day. For example, if you work all year and pay 
care expenses of $250 a month ($3,000 for the year), all the expenses are work-related. However, if you 
work or look for work for only 2 months and 15 days during the year and pay expenses of $250 a month, 
your work-related expenses are limited to $625 (2½ months x $250). 
Temporary absence from work. You do not have to figure your expenses for each day during a short, 
temporary absence from work, such as for vacation or a minor illness, if you have to pay for care anyway. 
Instead, you can figure your credit including the expenses you paid for the period of absence. 
An absence of 2 weeks or less is a short, temporary absence. An absence of more than 2 weeks may be 
considered a short, temporary absence, depending on the circumstances. 
Example
You pay a nanny to care for your 2-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter so you can 
work. You become ill and miss 4 months of work but receive sick pay. You continue 
to pay the nanny to care for the children while you are ill. Your absence is not a short, 
temporary absence, and your expenses are not considered work-related. 
Part-time work. If you work part-time, you generally must figure your expenses for each day. However, 
if you have to pay for care weekly, monthly, or in another way that includes both days worked and days 
not worked, you can figure your credit including the expenses you paid for days you did not work. Any 
day when you work at least 1 hour is a day of work.

 476  •  Chapter 31: Child and Dependent Care Credit
Example 1
You work 3 days a week. While you work, your 6-year-old child attends a dependent 
care center, which complies with all state and local regulations. You can pay the center 
$150 for any 3 days a week or $250 for 5 days a week. Your child attends the center 5 
days a week. Your work-related expenses are limited to $150 a week. 
 
Example 2
 
The facts are the same as in Example 1 except the center does not offer a 3-day option. 
The entire $250 weekly fee may be a work-related expense. 
Care of a Qualifying Person 
To be work related, your expenses must be to provide care for a qualifying person. You do not have 
to choose the least expensive way of providing the care. The cost of a paid care provider may be an 
expense for the care of a qualifying person even if another care provider is available at no cost.
Expenses are for the care of a qualifying person only if their main purpose is the person’s well-being and 
protection. 
Expenses for household services qualify if part of the services is for the care of qualifying persons. See 
Household services, later. 
Expenses not for care. Expenses for care do not include amounts you pay for food, clothing, education, 
and entertainment. However, you can include small amounts paid for these items if they are incidental to 
and cannot be separated from the cost of caring for the qualifying person.
Child support payments are not for care and do not qualify for the credit. 
Education. Expenses for a child in nursery school, pre-school, or similar programs for children below 
the level of kindergarten are expenses for care. Expenses to attend kindergarten or a higher grade are 
not expenses for care. Do not use these expenses to figure your credit.
However, expenses for before- or after-school care of a child in kindergarten or a higher grade may be 
expenses for care.
Summer school and tutoring programs are not for care. 

 477  •  Chapter 31: Child and Dependent Care Credit
Example 1
You take your 3-year-old child to a nursery school that provides lunch and educational 
activities as a part of its preschool childcare service. The lunch and educational activities 
are incidental to the childcare, and their cost cannot be separated from the cost of care. 
You can count the total cost when you figure the credit. 
 
Example 2
You are a member of the Armed  Forces, and you are ordered to a combat zone. To be 
able to comply with the order, you place your 10-year-old child in a boarding school. 
Only the part of the boarding school expense that is for the care of your child is a work-
related expense. You can count that part of the expense in figuring your credit if it can 
be separated from the cost of education. You cannot count any part of the amount you 
pay the school for your child’s education. 
Care outside your home. You can count the cost of care provided outside your home if the care is for 
your dependent under age 13 or any other qualifying person who regularly spends at least 8 hours each 
day in your home. 
Dependent care center. You can count care provided outside your home by a dependent care center 
only if the center complies with all state and local regulations that apply to these centers. 
A dependent care center is a place that provides care for more than six persons (other than persons who 
live there) and receives a fee, payment, or grant for providing services for any of those persons, even if 
the center is not run for profit. 
Camp. The cost of sending your child to an overnight camp is not considered a work-related expense. 
The  cost  of  sending  your  child  to  a  day  camp  may  be  a  work-related  expense,  even  if  the  camp 
specializes in a particular activity, such as computers or soccer. 
Transportation. If a care provider takes a qualifying person to or from a place where care is provided, 
that transportation is for the care of the qualifying person. This includes transportation by bus, subway, 
taxi, or private car. However, transportation not provided by a care provider is not for the care of a 
qualifying person. Also, if you pay the transportation cost for the care provider to come to your home, 
that expense is not for care of a qualifying person. 
Fees and deposits. Fees you paid to an agency to get the services of a care provider, deposits you paid 
to an agency or pre-school, application fees, and other indirect expenses are work-related expenses if 
you have to pay them to get care, even though they are not directly for care. However, a forfeited deposit 
is not for the care of a qualifying person if care is not provided. 

 478  •  Chapter 31: Child and Dependent Care Credit
Example 1
 
You paid a fee to an agency to get the services of the nanny who cares for your 2-year-
old daughter while you work. The fee you paid is a work-related expense. 
 
Example 2
You placed a deposit with a pre-school to reserve a place for your 3-year-old child. You 
later sent your child to a different pre-school and forfeited the deposit. The forfeited 
deposit is not for care and so is not a work-related expense. 
Household services. Expenses you pay for household services meet the work-related expense test if 
they are at least partly for the well-being and protection of a qualifying person. 
Household services are ordinary and usual services done in and around your home that are necessary 
to run your home. They include the services of a housekeeper, maid, or cook. However, they do not 
include the services of a chauffeur, bartender, or gardener. 
In this chapter, the term housekeeper refers to any household employee whose services include the 
care of a qualifying person. 
Taxes paid on wages. The taxes you pay on wages for qualifying child and dependent care services 
are work-related expenses. See Employment Taxes for Household Employers, later. 
Payments to Relatives or Dependents 
You can count work-related payments you make to relatives who are not your dependents, even if they 
live in your home. However, do not count any amounts you pay to:  
1. A person for whom you (or your spouse if filing jointly) can claim as a dependent,
2. Your child who was under age 19 at the end of the year, even if he or she is not your 
dependent,
3. A person who was your spouse any time during the year, or
4. The parent of your qualifying child who is your qualifying person and is under age 13.  

 479  •  Chapter 31: Child and Dependent Care Credit
JOINT RETURN TEST 
Generally, married couples must file a joint return to take the credit. However, if you are legally separated 
or living apart from your spouse, you may be able to file a separate return and still take the credit. 
Legally separated. You are not considered married if you are legally separated from your spouse under 
a decree of divorce or separate maintenance. You may be eligible to take the credit on your return using 
Head of Household filing status. 
Married  and  living  apart. You are not considered married and are eligible to take the credit if all  the  
following apply.  
1. You file a return apart from your spouse. 
2. Your home is the home of a qualifying person for more than half the year. 
3. You pay more than half the cost of keeping up your home for the year. 
4. Your spouse does not live in your home for the last 6 months of the year.  
Death of spouse. If your spouse died during the year and you do not remarry before the end of the year, 
you generally must file a joint return to take the credit. If you do remarry before the end of the year, the 
credit can be claimed on your deceased spouse’s return. 
CARE PROVIDER IDENTIFICATION TEST 
You must identify all persons or organizations that provide care for your child or dependent. Use Part I of 
Form 2441 to show the information. 
Information needed. To identify the care provider, you must give the provider’s:  
1. Name, 
2. Address, and 
3. Taxpayer identification number.  
If the care provider is an individual, the taxpayer identification number is his or her social security number 
or individual taxpayer identification number. If the care provider is an organization, then it is the employer 
identification number (EIN). 
You do not have to show the taxpayer identification number if the care provider is one of certain tax-
exempt organizations (such as a church or school). In this case, write “Tax-Exempt” in the space where 
Form 2441 asks for the number. 
If you cannot provide all of the information or if the information you provide is incorrect you must be able 
to show that you used due diligence (discussed later) in trying to furnish the necessary information.

Getting  the  information. You can use Form W-10 to request the required information from the care 
provider. If you do not use Form W-10, you can get the information from one of the other sources listed 
in the instructions for Form W-10 including:
1. A copy of the provider’s social security card, 
2. A copy of the provider’s completed Form W-4 if he or she is your household employee,
3. A copy of the statement furnished by your employer if the provider is your employer’s 
dependent care plan, or 
4. A recently printed letterhead or invoice that shows the provider’s name, address, and 
taxpayer identification number.  
Due diligence. If the care provider information you give is incorrect or incomplete, your credit may not 
be allowed. However, if you can show that you used due diligence in trying to supply the information, you 
can still claim the credit. 
You can show due diligence by getting and keeping the provider’s completed Form W-10 or one of the 
other sources of information listed earlier. Care providers can be penalized if they do not provide this 
information to you or if they provide incorrect information. 
Provider refusal. If the provider refuses to give you their identifying information, you should report on 
Form 2441 whatever information you have (such as the name and address) on the form you use to claim 
the credit. Enter “See Attached Statement” in the columns calling for the information you do not have. 
Then, attach a statement explaining that you requested the information from the care provider, but the 
provider did not give you the information. Be sure to write your name and social security number on 
this statement. The statement will show that you used due diligence in trying to furnish the necessary 
information.
III. HOW TO FIGURE THE CREDIT 
Your credit is a percentage of your work-related expenses. Your expenses are subject to the earned 
income limit and the dollar limit. The percentage is based on your adjusted gross income. 
FIGURING TOTAL WORK-RELATED EXPENSES 
To figure the credit for 2024 work-related expenses, count only those you paid by December 31, 2024. 
Expenses prepaid in an earlier year. If you pay for services before they are provided, you can count 
the prepaid expenses only in the year the care is received. Claim the expenses for the later year as if 
they were actually paid in that later year. 
Expenses  not  paid  until  the  following  year.  Do not count 2023 expenses that you paid in 2024 as 
work-related expenses for 2024. You may be able to claim an additional credit for them on your 2024 
return, but you must figure it separately. 

 481  •  Chapter 31: Child and Dependent Care Credit
Expenses reimbursed. If a state social services agency pays you a nontaxable amount to reimburse 
you  for  some  of  your  child and dependent care expenses, you cannot count the expenses that are 
reimbursed as work-related expenses. 
Example
 
You paid work-related expenses of $3,000. You are reimbursed $2,000 by a state social 
services agency. You can use only $1,000 to figure your credit. 
Medical  expenses. Some expenses for the care of qualifying persons who are not able to care for 
themselves may qualify as work-related expenses and also as medical  expenses.  You  can  use  them  
either  way,  but  you  cannot  use  the  same  expenses  to  claim  both  a  credit  and  a  medical  expense 
deduction. 
If you use these expenses to figure the credit and they are more than the earned income limit or the 
dollar limit, discussed later, you can add the excess to your medical expenses. However, if you use your 
total expenses to figure your medical expense deduction, you cannot use any part of them to figure your 
credit. 
Dependent Care Benefits 
Dependent care benefits include:  
1. Amounts your employer pays directly to either you or your care provider for the care of 
your qualifying person while you work, 
2. The fair market value of care in a daycare facility provided or sponsored by your employer, 
and
3. Pre-tax contributions you made under a dependent care flexible spending arrangement.
Your salary may have been reduced to pay for these benefits. If you received benefits, they should be 
shown on your W-2 form. See Statement for employee, later. 
Exclusion  or  deduction.  If  your  employer  provides  dependent care benefits under a qualified plan, 
you may be able to exclude these benefits from your income. Your employer can tell you whether your 
benefit plan qualifies. To claim the exclusion, you must complete Part III of Form 2441. 
If  you  are  self-employed and receive benefits from a qualified dependent care benefit plan, you are 
treated as both employer and employee. Therefore, you would not get an exclusion from wages. Instead, 
you would get a deduction on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, Schedule C, Schedule E, or Schedule F. To claim 
the deduction, you must use Form 2441.

 482  •  Chapter 31: Child and Dependent Care Credit
The amount you can exclude or deduct is limited to the smallest of:
1. The total amount of dependent care benefits you received during the year,
2. The total amount of qualified expenses you incurred during the year,
3. Your earned income,
4. Your spouse’s earned income, or
5. The maximum amount allowed under your dependent care plan. For 2024, the maximum 
amount that can be excluded from an employee’s income is $5,000 ($2,500 if married 
filing separately).
The definition of earned income for the exclusion or deduction is the same as the definition used when 
figuring  the  credit  except  that  earned  income  for  the  exclusion  or  deduction  does  not  include  any 
dependent care benefits you receive. See Earned Income Limit, later.
Statement for employee. Your employer must give you a Form W-2 (or similar statement), showing in 
box 10 the total amount of dependent care benefits provided to you during the year under a qualified 
plan. Your employer will also include any dependent care benefits over $5,000 ($2,500 if married filiing 
separately) in your wages shown on your Form W-2 in box 1. 
Effect of exclusion. If  you  exclude  dependent  care  benefits  from  your  income,  the  amount  of  the 
excluded benefits:  
1. Is not included in your work-related expenses, and 
2. Reduces the dollar limit, discussed later. 
EARNED INCOME LIMIT 
The amount of work-related expenses you use to figure your credit cannot be more than:  
1. Your earned income for the year if you are single at the end of the year, or
2. The smaller of your or your spouse’s earned income for the year if you are married at the 
end of the year.  
Earned income is defined under Earned Income Test, earlier. 
Tip
 
For purposes of item (2), use your spouse’s earned income for the entire year, even if 
you were married for only part of the year.

 483  •  Chapter 31: Child and Dependent Care Credit
Separated  spouse.  If  you  are  legally  separated  or  married  and  living  apart  from  your  spouse  (as  
described under Joint Return Test, earlier), you are not considered married for purposes of the earned 
income limit. Use only your income in figuring the earned income limit. 
Surviving spouse. If your spouse died during the year and you file a joint return as a surviving spouse, 
you may, but are not required to, take into account the earned income of your spouse who died during 
the year. 
Community  property  laws.  You  should  disregard  community property laws when you figure earned 
income for this credit. 
Student-spouse or spouse not able to care for self. Your spouse who is either a full-time student or 
not able to care for himself or herself is treated as having earned income. His or her earned income for 
each month is considered to be at least $250 if there is one qualifying person in your home, or at least 
$500 if there are two or more. 
Spouse works. If your spouse works during that month, use the higher of $250 (or $500) or his or her 
actual earned income for that month. 
Spouse qualifies for part of month. If your spouse is a full-time student or not able to care for himself 
or herself for only part of a month, the full $250 (or $500) still applies for that month.
You are a student or not able to care for yourself. These rules also apply if you are a student or not 
able to care for yourself and you are filing a joint return. For each month or part of a month you are a 
student or not able to care for yourself, your earned income is considered to be at least $250 (or $500). If 
you also work during that month, use the higher of $250 (or $500) or your actual earned income for that 
month.
Both spouses qualify. If, in the same month, both you and your spouse are either full-time students or 
not able to care for yourselves, only one spouse can be considered to have this earned income of $250 
(or $500) for that month. 
DOLLAR LIMIT 
There is a dollar limit on the amount of your work-related expenses you can use to figure the credit. For 
2024, this limit is $3,000 for one qualifying person, or $6,000 for two or more qualifying persons. 
Yearly limit. The dollar limit is a yearly limit. The amount of the dollar limit remains the same no matter 
how long, during the year, you have a qualifying person in your household. Use the $3,000 limit if you 
paid work-related expenses for the care of one qualifying person at any time during the year. Use $6,000 
if you paid work-related expenses for the care of more than one qualifying person at any time during the 
year. 
Reduced Dollar Limit 
If  you  received  dependent care benefits from your employer that you exclude from your income, you 
must subtract that amount from the dollar limit that applies to you. Your reduced dollar limit is figured in 
Part III of Form 2441. See Dependent Care Benefits, earlier, for information on excluding or deducting 
these benefits. 

 484  •  Chapter 31: Child and Dependent Care Credit
Example
George is a widower with one child and earns $24,000 a year. He pays work-related 
expenses of $2,900 for the care of his 4-year-old child and qualifies to claim the credit 
for child and dependent care expenses. His employer pays an additional $1,000 under 
a dependent care benefit plan. This $1,000 is excluded from George’s income.
Although  the  dollar  limit  for  his  work-related  expenses  is  $3,000  (one  qualifying 
person), George figures his credit on only $2,000 of the $2,900 work-related expenses 
he paid. This is because his dollar limit is reduced as shown next.
George’s Reduced Dollar Limit
1) Maximum allowable expenses for one qualifying person$3,000
2) Minus: Dependent care benefits George excludes from income1,000
3) Reduced dollar limit on expenses George can use for the credit$2,000
AMOUNT OF CREDIT 
To determine the amount of your credit, multiply your work-related expenses (after applying the earned 
income and dollar limits) by a percentage. This percentage depends on your adjusted gross income 
shown on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 11. The maximum percentage of your work-related expenses 
allowed as a credit for 2024 is 35 percent.
The following chart illustrates the percentage to be used based on adjusted gross income:
IF your adjusted gross 
income is over...
BUT not over...THEN the percentage is...
$0$15,00035%

 485  •  Chapter 31: Child and Dependent Care Credit
I V.  HOW TO CLAIM THE CREDIT 
To claim the credit, you must file Form 1040 or 1040-SR. 
Form 1040 or 1040-SR. You must complete Form 2441 and attach it to your Form 1040 or 1040-SR. 
Enter the credit on Schedule 3 (Form 1040), line 2. 
Limit on credit. The amount of credit you can claim is limited to the amount of your tax. 
Tax credit not refundable. For 2024, you cannot get a refund for any part of the credit that is more than 
this limit. 
V.   EMPLOYMENT TAXES FOR HOUSEHOLD EMPLOYERS 
If you pay someone to come to your home and care for your dependent or spouse, you may be a 
household employer. If you are a household employer, you will need an employer identification number 
(EIN) and you may have to pay employment taxes. If the individuals who work in your home are self-
employed, you are not liable for any of the taxes discussed in this section. Self-employed persons who 
are in business for themselves are not household employees. Usually, you are not a household employer 
if the person who cares for your dependent or spouse does so at his or her home or place of business. 
If you use a placement agency that exercises control over what work is done and how it will be done by 
a babysitter or companion who works in your home, that person is not your employee. This control could 
include providing rules of conduct and appearance and requiring regular reports. In this case, you do not 
have to pay employment taxes. But, if an agency merely gives you a list of sitters and you hire one from 
that list, the sitter may be your employee. 
If you have a household employee you may be subject to:  
1. Social security and Medicare taxes,  
2. Federal unemployment tax, and 
3. Federal income tax withholding. 
Social security and Medicare taxes are generally withheld from the employee’s pay and matched by the 
employer. Federal unemployment (FUTA) tax is paid by the employer only and provides for payments of 
unemployment compensation to workers who have lost their jobs. Federal income tax is withheld from 
the employee’s total pay if the employee asks you to do so and you agree. 
State employment tax. You may also have to pay state unemployment tax for your household employee. 
Contact your state unemployment tax office for information. You should also find out whether you need 
to pay or collect other state employment taxes or carry workers’ compensation insurance.

CHAPTER 32: CREDIT FOR THE 
ELDERLY OR THE DISABLED
Chapter Objective
After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• Identify who qualifies to take the credit for the elderly or disabled.
I.   INTRODUCTION 
If you qualify, you may be able to reduce the tax you owe by taking the credit  for  the  elderly  or  the  
disabled on Schedule R (Form 1040).
This chapter explains: 
• Who qualifies for the credit for the elderly or the disabled, and 
• How to figure the credit. 
You may be able to take the credit for the elderly or disabled if: 
• You are age 65 or older at the end of 2024, or 
• You retired on permanent and total disability and have taxable disability income.
II. CAN YOU TAKE THE CREDIT? 
You can take the credit for the elderly or the disabled if you meet both of the following requirements.  
1. You are a qualified individual. 
2. Your income is not more than certain limits. 
You can use Figure 32-A and Table 32-1 as guides to see if you are eligible for the credit. 
Use Figure 32-A first to see if you are a qualified individual. If you are, go to Table 32-1 to make sure 
your income is not too high to take the credit.

 490  •  Chapter 32: Credit for the Elderly or the Disabled
FIGURE 32-A. ARE YOU A QUALIFIED INDIVIDUAL?
1. However, you may be able to claim this credit even if you lived with your spouse during the first 6 months of the tax year, as 
long as you qualify to file as head of household. You qualify to file as head of household if you are considered unmarried and 
meet certain other conditions. See chapter 2 for more information.
2. If you were a nonresident alien at any time during the tax year and were married to a U.S. citizen or resident at the end of the 
tax year, see U.S. Citizen or Resident under Qualified Individual. If you and your spouse choose to treat you as a U.S. resident, 
answer “yes” to this question.
3. Mandatory retirement age is the age set by your employer at which you would have been required to retire, had you not 
become disabled.

QUALIFIED INDIVIDUAL 
You are a qualified individual for this credit if you are a U.S. citizen or resident and either of the following 
applies.  
1. You were age 65 or older at the end of 2024 
2. You were under age 65 at the end of 2024 and all three of the following statements are 
true.  
a) You retired on permanent and total disability (explained later). 
b) You received taxable disability income for 2024. 
c) On January 1, 2024, you had not reached mandatory retirement age (defined 
later under Disability income).  
Age 65. You are considered to be age 65 on the day before your 65th birthday. Therefore, if you were 
born on January 1, 1960, you are considered to be age 65 at the end of 2024. 
U.S. Citizen or Resident Alien
You must be a U.S. citizen or resident alien (or be treated as a resident alien) to take the credit. Generally, 
you cannot take the credit if you were a nonresident alien at any time during the tax year.

 492  •  Chapter 32: Credit for the Elderly or the Disabled
Exceptions
You may be able to take the credit if you are a nonresident alien who is married to a 
U.S. citizen or resident alien at the end of the tax year and you and your spouse choose 
to treat you as a U.S. resident alien. If you make that choice, both you and your spouse 
are taxed on your worldwide incomes. 
If you were a nonresident alien at the beginning of the year and a resident alien at the 
end of the year, and you were married to a U.S. citizen or resident alien at the end of the 
year, you may be able to choose to be treated as a U.S. resident alien for the entire year. 
In that case, you may be allowed to take the credit.
Married Persons 
Generally, if you are married at the end of the tax year, you and your spouse must file a joint return to 
take the credit. However, if you and your spouse did not live in the same household at any time during 
the tax year, you can file either joint or separate returns and still take the credit. 
Head  of  household.  You can file as head of household and qualify to take the credit, even if your 
spouse lived with you during the first 6 months of the year, if you meet certain tests. 
Under Age 65 
If you are under age 65 at the end of 2024, you can qualify for the credit only if you are retired on 
permanent and total disability and have taxable disability income.
You are retired on permanent and total disability if:
• You were permanently and totally disabled when you retired, and
• You retired on disability before the close of the tax year.
Even if you do not retire formally, you are considered retired on disability when you have stopped working 
because of your disability. 
Permanent and total disability. You are permanently and totally disabled if you cannot engage in any 
substantial gainful activity because of your physical or mental condition. A qualified physician must certify 
that the condition has lasted or can be expected to last continuously for 12 months or more, or that the 
condition can be expected to result in death. See Physician’s statement, later. 
Substantial gainful activity. Substantial gainful activity is the performance of significant duties over a 
reasonable period of time while working for pay or profit, or in work generally done for pay or profit. Full-
time work (or part-time work done at your employer’s convenience) in a competitive work situation for at 
least the minimum wage conclusively shows that you are able to engage in substantial gainful activity. 

 493  •  Chapter 32: Credit for the Elderly or the Disabled
Substantial gainful activity is not work you do to take care of yourself or your home. It is not unpaid 
work  on  hobbies,  institutional  therapy  or  training,  school  attendance,  clubs,  social  programs,  and 
similar activities. However, the nature of the work you perform may show that you are able to engage in 
substantial gainful activity. 
The fact that you have not worked or have been unemployed for some time is not, of itself, conclusive 
evidence that you cannot engage in substantial gainful activity. 
Sheltered  employment. Certain work offered at qualified locations to physically or mentally impaired 
persons is considered sheltered employment. These qualified locations include work centers that are 
certified  by  the  Department  of  Labor,  hospitals  and  similar  institutions,  homebound  programs,  and 
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) sponsored homes. 
Compared to commercial employment, pay is lower for sheltered employment. Therefore, one usually 
does not look for sheltered employment if he or she can get other employment. The fact that one has 
accepted sheltered employment is not proof of that person’s ability to engage in substantial gainful 
activity. 
Physician’s statement. If you are under age 65, you must have your physician complete a statement 
certifying  that  you  were  permanently  and  totally  disabled  on  the  date  you  retired. You  can  use  the 
statement in the Instructions for Schedule R. 
You do not have to file this statement with your tax return, but you must keep it for your records. 
Veterans.  If  the  Department  of  Veterans Affairs  (VA)  certifies  that  you  are  permanently  and  totally 
disabled, you can substitute VA Form 21-0172, Certification of Permanent and Total Disability, for the 
physician’s statement you are required to keep. VA Form 21-0172 must be signed by a person authorized 
by the VA to do so. You can get this form from your local VA regional office. 
Physician’s statement obtained in earlier year. If you got a physician’s statement in an earlier year 
and, due to your continued disabled condition, you were unable to engage in any substantial gainful 
activity during 2024, you may not need to get another physician’s statement for 2024. For a detailed 
explanation of the conditions you must meet, see the instructions for Part II of Schedule R. If you meet 
the required conditions, check the box on line 2 of Part II of Schedule R. 
If you checked box 4, 5, or 6 in Part I of Schedule R, enter in the space above the box on line 2 in Part II, 
the first name(s) of the spouse(s) for whom the box is checked. 
Disability  income. If you are under age 65, you can qualify for the credit only if you have taxable 
disability income. Disability income must meet both of the following requirements.  
1. It must be paid under your employer’s accident or health plan or pension plan. 
2. It must be included in your income as wages (or payments instead of wages) for the time 
you are absent from work because of permanent and total disability.  

 494  •  Chapter 32: Credit for the Elderly or the Disabled
Payments that are not disability income. Any payment you receive from a plan that does not provide 
for disability retirement is not disability income. Any lump-sum payment for accrued annual leave that 
you receive when you retire on disability is a salary payment and is not disability income. 
For purposes of the credit for the elderly or the disabled, disability income does not include amounts 
you receive after you reach mandatory retirement age. Mandatory retirement age is the age set by your 
employer at which you would have had to retire, had you not become disabled. 
INCOME LIMITS 
To determine if you can claim the credit, you must consider two income limits. The first limit is the amount 
of your adjusted gross income (AGI). The second limit is the amount of nontaxable social security and 
other nontaxable pensions, annuities, or disability income you received. The limits are shown in Table 
32-1, earlier. 
If your AGI and nontaxable pensions, annuities, or disability income are less than the income limits, you 
may be able to claim the credit. See Figuring the Credit, next. 
Caution!
 
If your AGI or your nontaxable pensions, annuities, or disability income are equal to or 
more than the income limits, you cannot take the credit.
III. FIGURING THE CREDIT 
You can figure the credit yourself or the IRS will figure it for you. 
CREDIT FIGURED BY YOU
To figure the credit yourself, first check the box in Part I of Schedule R that applies to you. Only check 
one box in Part I. If you check box 2, 4, 5, 6, or 9 in Part I, also complete Part II of Schedule R.
Next, figure the amount of your credit using Part III of Schedule R. 
Finally, report the amount from line 22 of Schedule R on your tax return. Then, check box c on Schedule 
3 (Form 1040), line 6d, and enter “Sch R” on the line next to that box. Attach Schedule R to your return.
Limit on credit. The amount of the credit you can claim is generally limited to the amount of your tax. 
Use the Credit Limit Worksheet in the Instructions for Schedule R to determine if your credit is limited.

CHAPTER 32: TEST YOUR KNOWLEDGE

CHAPTER 33: CHILD TAX CREDIT/CREDIT FOR 
OTHER DEPENDENTS
Chapter Objective
After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• Recall the limits of the child tax credit.
I.   INTRODUCTION 
The child tax credit (CTC) is a credit that may reduce your tax by as much as $2,000 for each of your 
qualifying children in 2024. 
The additional child tax credit (ACTC) is a credit you may be able to take if you are not able to claim the 
full amount of the child tax credit. 
The other dependents credit (ODC) is a credit that may reduce your tax by as much as $500 for each 
eligible dependent.
Caution!
 
The CTC and the ACTC should not be confused with the child and dependent care  
credit discussed in Chapter 31.
II. QUALIFYING CHILD FOR THE CTC  
A qualifying child for purposes of the child tax credit is a child who meets all of the following conditions:
1. The  child  is  your  son,  daughter,  stepchild,  foster  child,  brother,  sister,  stepbrother, 
stepsister, half brother, half sister, or a descendant of any of them;
2. The child was under age 17 at the end of 2024;
3. The child did not provide over half his or her own support for 2024;
4. The child lived with you for more than half of 2024;
5. The child is claimed as a dependent on your return;

 498  •  Chapter 33: Child Tax Credit/Credit for Other Dependents
6. The child does not file a joint return for the year (or files it only to claim a refund of 
withheld income tax or estimated tax paid); and
7. The child was a U.S. citizen, a U.S. national, or a U.S. resident alien. If the child was 
adopted, see Adopted child, later.
Example
Your son turned 17 on December 30, 2024. He is a citizen of the United States and 
you claimed him as a dependent on your return. You cannot use him to claim the CTC 
because he was not under age 17 at the end of 2024. 
Adopted child. An adopted child is always treated as your own child. An adopted child includes a child 
lawfully placed with you for legal adoption.
If you are a U.S. citizen or U.S. national and your adopted child lived with you as a member of your 
household in 2024, that child meets condition (7) above to be a qualifying child for the child tax credit.
III. CREDIT FOR OTHER DEPENDENTS (ODC)
This credit is for individuals with a dependent who meets additional conditions (described later).
Note
 
This credit is different from and in addition to the credit for child and dependent care 
expenses that you also may be eligible to claim.
The maximum amount you can claim for this credit is $500 for each qualifying dependent. See Limits on 
the CTC and ODC, later.
QUALIFYING PERSON FOR THE ODC
A person qualifies you for the ODC if the person meets all of the following conditions.
1. The person is claimed as a dependent on your return. 
2. The person cannot be used by you to claim the CTC or ACTC. See Child  Tax  Credit  
(CTC), earlier.
3. The person is a U.S. citizen, U.S. national, or U.S. resident alien.

 499  •  Chapter 33: Child Tax Credit/Credit for Other Dependents
Example
 
Your 10-year-old nephew lives in Mexico and qualifies as your dependent. He is not a 
U.S. citizen, U.S. national, or U.S. resident alien. You cannot use him to claim the ODC.
Caution!
 
You cannot use the same child to claim both the CTC (or ACTC) and the ODC.
In addition to being a qualifying person for the ODC (defined earlier), your qualifying person must have 
an SSN, ITIN, or ATIN issued to him or her on or before the due date of your 2024 return (including 
extensions). If your qualifying person has not been issued an SSN, ITIN, or ATIN by that date, you 
cannot use the individual to claim the ODC.
I V.  LIMITS ON THE CTC AND ODC 
The maximum credit amount of your CTC or ODC may be reduced if:
• Your modified adjusted gross income (AGI) is above the amount shown below for your 
filing status. 
a) Married filing jointly - $400,000. 
b) All other filing statuses - $200,000. 
Modified AGI. For purposes of the child tax credit, your modified AGI is your AGI plus the following 
amounts that may apply to you. 
• Any amount excluded from income because of the exclusion of income from Puerto Rico.
 ▫On the dotted line next to Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 11, enter the amount 
excluded and identify it as “EPRI”
 ▫Also attach a copy of any Form(s) 499R-2/W-2PR to your return
• Any amount on line 45 or line 50 of Form 2555, Foreign Earned Income. 
• Any amount on line 15 of Form 4563, Exclusion  of  Income  for  Bona  Fide  Residents  of  
American Samoa. 
If you do not have any of the above, your modified AGI is the same as your AGI.

 500  •  Chapter 33: Child Tax Credit/Credit for Other Dependents
AGI. Your AGI is the amount on Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR, line 11.
V.   CLAIMING THE CTC AND ODC
To claim the CTC or ODC, make sure you meet the following requirements.
• You must file Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR and include the name and TIN of each 
dependent for whom you are claiming the CTC or ODC.
• You must file Schedule 8812 (Form 1040).
• You must file Form 8862, if applicable. 
• You must have a timely issued TIN on your tax return for you and your spouse (if filing 
jointly). 
• For each qualifying child under 17 for whom you are claiming the CTC, you must enter 
the required SSN for the child in column (2) of the Dependents section of your tax return 
and check the Child tax credit box in column (4). 
• For  each  dependent  for  whom  you  are  claiming  the  ODC,  you  must  enter  the  timely 
issued TIN for the dependent in column (2) of the Dependents section of your tax return 
and check the Credit for other dependents box in column (4). 
Caution!
 
Do not check both the Child tax credit box and the Credit for other dependents box for 
the same person.
VI. ADDITIONAL CHILD TAX CREDIT (ACTC)
This credit is for certain individuals who get less than the full amount of the child tax credit. The additional 
child tax credit may give you a refund even if you do not owe any tax.
Caution!
 
The ODC cannot be used to figure the ACTC. Only your CTC can be used to figure your 
ACTC. If you are claiming the ODC but not the CTC, you cannot claim the ACTC.

 501  •  Chapter 33: Child Tax Credit/Credit for Other Dependents
Foreign earned income. If you file Form 2555 (relating to foreign earned income), you cannot claim the 
ACTC.
How  to  claim  the  additional  child  tax  credit.  To  claim  the  additional  child tax credit, see Schedule 
8812 (Form 1040) and its Instructions.

 505  •  Chapter 34: Education Credits
CHAPTER 34: EDUCATION CREDITS
Chapter Objective
After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• Identify the requirements for and benefits of the American opportunity credit and the lifetime 
learning credit.
I.   INTRODUCTION 
For 2024, there are two tax credits available to persons who pay expenses for higher (postsecondary) 
education. They are: 
• The American opportunity credit, and
• The lifetime learning credit. 
The chapter will present an overview of these education credits. 
Can  you  claim  more  than  one  education  credit  this  year? For 2024, you can claim one education 
credit for each eligible student. For example, if you elect to claim the American opportunity credit for a 
child on your 2024 tax return, you cannot, for that same child, also claim the lifetime learning credit for 
2024.
If you are eligible to claim the American opportunity credit and you are also eligible to claim the lifetime 
learning credit for the same student in the same year, you can choose to claim either credit, but not both.
If you pay qualified education expenses for more than one student in the same year, you can choose 
to take the American opportunity and the lifetime learning credits on a per-student, per-year basis. This 
means that, for example, you can claim the American opportunity credit for one student and the lifetime 
learning credit for another student in the same year. 
Differences between the American opportunity and lifetime learning credits.  There  are  several  
differences between these two credits. These differences are summarized in Table 34-1, next. 

 506  •  Chapter 34: Education Credits

II. WHO CAN CLAIM AN EDUCATION CREDIT
You may be able to claim an education credit if you, your spouse, or a dependent you claim on your tax 
return was a student enrolled at or attending an eligible educational institution. For 2024, the credits are 
based on the amount of qualified education expenses paid for the student in 2024 for academic periods 
beginning in 2024 and in the first 3 months of 2025. 
For example, if you paid $1,500 in December 2024 for qualified tuition for the spring 2025 semester 
beginning in January 2025, you may be able to use that $1,500 in figuring your 2024 education credit(s). 
Academic period. An academic period includes a semester, trimester, quarter, or other period of study 
(such as a summer school session) as reasonably determined by an educational institution. In the case 
of an educational institution that uses credit hours or clock hours and does not have academic terms, 
each payment period can be treated as an academic period. 
Eligible educational institution. An eligible educational institution is any college, university, vocational 
school, or other postsecondary educational institution eligible to participate in a student aid program 
administered by the U.S. Department of Education. It includes virtually all accredited public, nonprofit, 
and proprietary (privately owned profit-making) postsecondary institutions. 

 508  •  Chapter 34: Education Credits
Who  can  claim  a  dependent’s  expenses.  If  a  dependent  is  claimed  on  a  tax  return,  all  qualified 
education expenses of the student are treated as having been paid by the person claiming the dependent. 
Therefore, only the person claiming the dependent on a tax return can claim an education credit for the 
student. If a student is not claimed as a dependent on another person’s tax return, only the student can 
claim a credit.
Expenses  paid  by  a  third  party.  Qualified  education  expenses  paid  on  behalf  of  the  student  by 
someone  other  than  the  student  (such  as  a  relative)  are  treated  as  paid  by  the  student.  However, 
qualified education expenses paid (or treated as paid) by a student who is claimed as a dependent on 
your tax return are treated as paid by you. Therefore, you are treated as having paid expenses that were 
paid by the third party. 
Who cannot claim a credit. You cannot claim an education credit if any of the following apply. 
1. Your filing status is married filing separately.
2. You are claimed as a dependent on another person’s tax return, such as your parent’s 
return. 
3. You (or your spouse) were a nonresident alien for any part of 2024 and did not elect to be 
treated as a resident alien for tax purposes. 
4. You did not have a social security number (SSN) (or individual taxpayer identification 
number (ITIN)) by the due date of your 2024 return (including extensions); you cannot 
claim the American opportunity credit on either your original or an amended 2024 return, 
even if you later get an SSN (or ITIN). Also, you cannot claim this credit on your original 
or  amended  2024  return  for  a  student  who  did  not  have  an  SSN,  adoption  taxpayer 
identification number (ATIN), or ITIN by the due date of your return (including extensions), 
even if the student later gets one of those numbers.
5. Your MAGI is one of the following. 
a) American  opportunity  credit:  $180,000  or  more  if  married  filing  jointly,  or 
$90,000 or more if single, head of household, or qualifying surviving spouse. 
b) Lifetime learning credit: $180,000 or more if married filing jointly, or $90,000 
or more if single, head of household, or qualifying surviving spouse. 
Generally, your MAGI is the amount on your Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 11. However, if you are filing 
Form 2555 or Form 4563, or are excluding income from Puerto Rico, add to the amount on your Form 
1040 or 1040-SR, line 11, the amount of income you excluded.
Figure 34-A may be helpful in determining if you can claim an education credit on your tax return.

FIGURE 34-A. CAN YOU CLAIM AN EDUCATION CREDIT FOR 2024? 

 510  •  Chapter 34: Education Credits
III. QUALIFIED EDUCATION EXPENSES 
Generally, qualified education expenses are amounts paid in 2024 for tuition and fees required for the 
student’s enrollment or attendance at an eligible educational institution. It does not matter whether the 
expenses were paid in cash, by check, by credit or debit card, or with borrowed funds. 
Only certain expenses for course-related books, supplies, and equipment qualify. 
• American  opportunity  credit:  Qualified  education  expenses  include  amounts  spent  on 
books, supplies, and equipment needed for a course of study, whether or not the materials 
are purchased from the educational institution as a condition of enrollment or attendance. 
• Lifetime learning credit: Qualified education expenses include only amounts for books, 
supplies, and equipment only if required to be paid to the institution as a condition of 
enrollment or attendance. 
Qualified education expenses include nonacademic fees, such as student activity fees, athletic fees, 
or other expenses unrelated to the academic course of instruction, only if the fee must be paid to the 
institution as a condition of enrollment or attendance. However, fees for personal expenses (described 
below) are never qualified education expenses.
Qualified education expenses do not include amounts paid for: 
• Personal expenses. This means room and board, insurance, medical expenses (including 
student health fees), transportation, or other similar personal, living, or family expenses. 
• Any  course  or  other  education  involving  sports,  games,  or  hobbies,  or  any  noncredit 
course, unless such course or other education is part of the student’s degree program or 
(for the lifetime learning credit only) helps the student acquire or improve job skills. 
Paid  with  borrowed  funds.  You can claim an education credit for qualified education expenses paid 
with the proceeds of a loan. Use the expenses to figure the credit for the year in which the expenses 
are paid, not the year in which the loan is repaid. Treat loan payments sent directly to the educational 
institution as paid on the date the institution credits the student’s account. 
Student withdraws from class(es). You can claim an education credit for qualified education expenses 
not refunded when a student withdraws.
NO DOUBLE BENEFIT ALLOWED 
You cannot do any of the following. 
• Deduct higher education expenses on your income tax return (as, for example, a business 
expense) and also claim an education credit based on those same expenses. 
• Claim more than 1 education credit based on the same qualified education expenses. 

 511  •  Chapter 34: Education Credits
• Claim an education credit based on the same expenses used to figure the tax-free portion 
of a distribution from a Coverdell education savings account (ESA) or qualified tuition 
program (QTP). 
• Claim an education credit based on qualified education expenses paid with educational 
assistance,  such  as  a  tax-free  scholarship,  grant,  or  employer-provided  educational 
assistance. See Adjustments to Qualified Education Expenses, next. 
ADJUSTMENTS TO QUALIFIED EDUCATION EXPENSES 
For each student, reduce the qualified education expenses paid in 2024 by or on behalf of that student 
under the following rules. The result is the amount of adjusted qualified education expenses for each 
student. 
Tax-free  educational  assistance. For tax-free educational assistance received in 2024, reduce the 
qualified  educational  expenses  for  each  academic  period  by  the  amount  of  tax-free  educational 
assistance allocable to that academic period. See Academic period, earlier.
Tax-free educational assistance includes: 
• Tax-free parts of scholarships and fellowships (including Pell grants), 
• The tax-free part of employer-provided educational assistance, 
• Veterans’ educational assistance, and 
• Any other nontaxable (tax-free) payments (other than gifts  or  inheritances)  received  as  
educational assistance. 
Refunds. A refund of qualified education expenses may reduce qualified education expenses for the tax 
year or may require you to repay (recapture) the credit that you claimed in an earlier year. Some tax-
free educational assistance received after 2024 may be treated as a refund. See Tax-free educational 
assistance, earlier. 
Amounts  that  do  not  reduce  qualified  education  expenses. Do  not  reduce  qualified  education 
expenses by amounts paid with funds the student receives as: 
• Payment for services, such as wages, 
• A loan, 
• A gift, 
• An inheritance, or 
• A withdrawal from the student’s personal savings. 

 512  •  Chapter 34: Education Credits
Do not reduce the qualified education expenses by any scholarship or fellowship reported as income on 
the student’s tax return in the following situations. 
• The use of the money is restricted, by the terms of the grant, to costs of attendance (such 
as room and board) other than qualified education expenses. 
• The use of the money is not restricted.

 515  •  Chapter 35: Earned Income Credit (EIC)
CHAPTER 35: EARNED INCOME CREDIT (EIC)
Chapter Objective
After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• Recall the limit of investment income to qualify for the earned income credit.
I.   INTRODUCTION 
The earned income credit (EIC) is a tax credit for certain people who work and have a limited earned 
income. A tax credit usually means more money in your pocket. It reduces the amount of tax you owe. 
The EIC may also give you a refund.
Earned income amount is more. The maximum amount of income you can earn and still get the credit 
has increased. You may be able to take the credit if:
• You have three or more qualifying children and you earned less than $59,899 ($66,819 if 
married filing jointly),
• You have two qualifying children and you earned less than $55,768 ($62,688 if married 
filing jointly),
• You have one qualifying child and you earned less than $49,084 ($56,004 if married filing 
jointly), or
• You do not have a qualifying child and you earned less than $18,591 ($25,511 if married 
filing jointly).
Your adjusted gross income also must be less than the amount in the above list that applies to you.
Investment income amount is more. The maximum amount of investment income you can have and 
still get the credit is $11,600.
How do you get the earned income credit? To claim the EIC, you must:  
1. Qualify by meeting certain rules, and 
2. File a tax return, even if you:  
a) Do not owe any tax, 
b) Did not earn enough money to file a return, or 
c) Did not have income taxes withheld from your pay. 

 516  •  Chapter 35: Earned Income Credit (EIC)
When you complete your return, you can figure your EIC by using a worksheet in the instructions for 
Form 1040 or 1040-SR. Or, if you prefer, you can let the IRS figure the credit for you. 
II. DO YOU QUALIFY FOR THE CREDIT?
To qualify to claim the EIC, you must first meet all of the rules explained in Part A, Rules for Everyone. 
Then, you must meet the rules in Part B, Rules If You Have a Qualifying Child, or Part C, Rules If You Do 
Not Have a Qualifying Child. There is one final rule you must meet in Part D, Figuring and Claiming the 
EIC. You qualify for the credit if you meet all the rules in each part that applies to you.
• If you have a qualifying child, the rules in Parts A, B, and D apply to you.
• If you do not have a qualifying child, the rules in Parts A, C, and D apply to you.
IF IMPROPER CLAIM MADE IN PRIOR YEAR 
If your EIC for any year after 1996 was denied or reduced for any reason other than a math or clerical 
error, you must attach a completed Form 8862 to your next tax return if you wish to claim the EIC. You 
must also qualify to claim the EIC by meeting the rules. 
If your EIC was denied or reduced as a result of a math or clerical error, do not attach Form 8862 to your 
next tax return. For example, if your arithmetic is incorrect, the IRS can correct it. If you do not provide 
a  correct  social security number, the IRS can deny the EIC. These kinds of errors are called math or 
clerical errors. 
If your EIC for any year after 1996 was denied and it was determined that your error was due to reckless 
or intentional disregard of the EIC rules, then you cannot claim the EIC for the next 2 years. If your error 
was due to fraud, then you cannot claim the EIC for the next 10 years.

Example 1
You, your 5-year-old son, and your son’s father lived together all year. You and your 
son’s father are not married. Your son is a qualifying child of both you and his father 
because he meets the relationship, age, residency, and joint return tests for both you 
and his father. Your earned income and AGI are $12,000, and your son’s father’s earned 
income and AGI are $14,000. Neither of you had any other income. Your son’s father 
agrees to let you treat the child as a qualifying child. This means, if your son’s father 
does not claim your son as a qualifying child for the EIC or any of the other tax benefits 
listed earlier, you can claim him as a qualifying child for the EIC and any other tax 
benefits listed for which you qualify. 
Example 2
You and your 7-year-old niece, your sister’s child, lived with your mother all year. 
You are 25 years old, and your AGI is $9,300. Your only income was from a part-time 
job. Your mother’s AGI is $15,000. Her only income was from her job. Your niece’s 
parents file jointly, have an AGI of less than $9,000, and do not live with you or their 
child. Your niece is a qualifying child of both you and your mother because she meets 
the relationship, age, residency, and joint return tests for both you and your mother. 
However, only your mother can treat her as a qualifying child. This is because your 
mother’s AGI, $15,000, is more than your AGI, $9,300.

CHAPTER 36: PREMIUM TAX CREDIT (PTC)
Chapter Objective
After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• Recognize who is eligible to claim the premium tax credit.
I.   INTRODUCTION
You may be able to take the PTC only for health insurance coverage in a qualified health plan purchased 
through a Health Insurance Marketplace (also known as an Exchange). This includes a qualified health 
plan purchased on healthcare.gov or through a state Marketplace.
This chapter provides an overview of the following.
• What is the PTC.
• Who can take the PTC.
• How to claim the credit.
II. WHAT IS THE PREMIUM TAX CREDIT (PTC)?
Premium  tax  credit  (PTC).  The PTC is a tax credit for certain people who enroll, or whose family 
member enrolls, in a qualified health plan. The credit provides financial assistance to pay the premiums 
for the qualified health plan offered through a Marketplace by reducing the amount of tax you owe, giving 
you a refund, or increasing your refund amount. You must file Form 8962 to compute and take the PTC 
on your tax return.
Advance payments of the premium tax credit (APTC). APTC is a payment made to your insurance 
provider that pays for part or all of the premiums for a qualified health plan covering you or an individual 
in your tax family. Your APTC eligibility is based on the Marketplace’s estimate of the PTC you will be 
able to take on your tax return. If APTC was paid for you or an individual in your tax family, you must 
complete Form 8962 to reconcile (compare) the APTC with your PTC. If the APTC is more than your 
PTC, you have excess APTC. If the APTC is less than the PTC, you can get a credit for the difference, 
which reduces your tax payment or increases your refund. 
Changes in circumstances. The Marketplace determined your eligibility for and the amount of your 2024 
APTC using projections of your income and the number of individuals you certified to the Marketplace 
would be in your tax family (yourself, spouse, and dependents) when you enrolled in a qualified health 
plan. If this information changed during 2024 and you did not promptly report it to the Marketplace, the 
amount of APTC paid may be substantially different from the amount of PTC you can take on your tax 
return. 

 522  •  Chapter 36: Premium Tax Credit (PTC)
III. WHO CAN TAKE THE PTC?
You can take the PTC for 2024 if you meet all the conditions under (1), (2), and (3) below.
1. For at least one month of the year, all of the following were true.
a) An individual in your tax family was enrolled in a qualified health plan offered 
through the Marketplace on the first day of the month;
b) The individual was not eligible for minimum essential coverage, other than 
coverage in the individual market; and
c) The  portion  of  the  enrollment  premiums  for  the  month  for  which  you  are  
responsible  was  paid  by  the  due  date  of  your  tax  return  (not  including 
extensions).
2. No one can claim you as a dependent for the year.
3. You are an applicable taxpayer for 2024. To be an applicable taxpayer, you must meet all 
of the following requirements.
a) For 2024, your household income is at least 100% of the Federal poverty line 
for your family size (provided in Tables 1-1, 1-2, and 1-3, in the Instructions 
for  Form  8962).  See  the  Instructions  for  Form  8962  for  exceptions  when 
household income is below 100% of the Federal poverty line.
b) If you were married at the end of 2024, generally you must file a joint return. 
However, filing a separate return from your spouse will not disqualify you 
from being an applicable taxpayer if you meet certain requirements described 
under Married taxpayers in the Instructions for Form 8962.
You  are  not  entitled  to  the  PTC  for  health  coverage  for  an  individual  for  any  period  during  which  the  
individual is not lawfully present in the United States.
I V.  HOW TO TAKE THE PTC?
You must file Form 8962 with your income tax return if any of the following apply to you.
• You are taking the PTC.
• APTC was paid for you or another individual in your tax family.
• APTC was paid for an individual for whom you told the Marketplace would be in your 
tax  family  and  neither  you  nor  anyone  else  included  that  individual  in  a  tax  family.  See  
Individual enrolled who is not included in a tax family under Lines 12 Through 23 - Monthly 
Calculation in the Instructions for Form 8962.
If any of the circumstances above apply to you, you must file an income tax return and attach Form 8962 
even if you are not otherwise required to file. You must file Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR.

 523  •  Chapter 36: Premium Tax Credit (PTC)
Form 1095-A. You will need Form 1095-A to complete Form 8962. The Marketplace uses Form 1095-A 
to report certain information to the IRS about individuals who enrolled in a qualified health plan through 
the Marketplace. The Marketplace sends copies to individuals to allow them to accurately file a tax return 
taking the PTC and reconciling APTC. For coverage in 2024, the Marketplace is required to provide or 
send Form 1095-A to the individual(s) identified in the Marketplace enrollment application by January 31, 
2025. 
Under  certain  circumstances  (for  example,  where  two  spouses  enroll  in  a  qualified  health  plan  and 
divorce during the year), the Marketplace will provide Form 1095-A to one taxpayer, but another taxpayer 
will also need the information from that form to complete Form 8962. The recipient of Form 1095-A 
should provide a copy to other taxpayers as needed.
Allocating  policy  amounts.  You  need  to  allocate  policy  amounts  (enrollment  premiums,  LCSP 
premiums, and/or APTC) on a Form 1095-A between your tax family and another tax family if:
• The policy covered at least one individual in your tax family and at least one individual in 
another tax family, and
• You received a Form 1095-A for the policy that does not accurately reflect the members 
of  your  tax  family  who  were  enrolled  in  the  policy  (meaning  that  it  either  lists  someone  
who is not in your tax family or does not list a member of your tax family who was enrolled 
in the policy) or the other tax family received a Form 1095-A for the policy that includes a 
member of your tax family.
If these conditions apply to you, check the “Yes” box on line 9 of Form 8962. For each policy to which the 
two conditions above apply, follow the instructions in Table 3. Shared Policy Allocation—Line 9, in the 
Form 8962 instructions, to determine which allocation rule applies for that qualified health plan.
A qualified health plan may have covered at least one individual in your tax family and one individual not 
in your tax family if:
• You got divorced during the year,
• You are married but filing a separate return from your spouse,
• You or an individual in your tax family was enrolled in a qualified health plan by someone 
who is not part of your tax family (for example, your ex-spouse enrolled a child whom you 
are claiming as a dependent), or
• You or an individual in your tax family enrolled someone not part of your tax family in a 
qualified health plan (for example, you enrolled a child whom your ex-spouse is claiming 
as a dependent).

CHAPTER 37: OTHER CREDITS
Chapter Objective
After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• Identify various nonrefundable and refundable credits available for income tax purposes.
I.   IMPORTANT 
Adoption credit. The maximum adoption credit has been increased to $16,810 for 2024.
II. INTRODUCTION 
This chapter discusses the following nonrefundable credits. 
• Adoption credit.
• Credit to holders of tax credit bonds. 
• Foreign tax credit. 
• Mortgage interest credit. 
• Nonrefundable credit for prior year minimum tax. 
• Residential energy credit.
• Retirement savings contributions credit. 
This chapter also discusses the following refundable credits. 
• Credit for tax on undistributed capital gain.
• Credit for Excess Social Security Tax or Railroad Retirement Tax Withheld. 
Nonrefundable credits. The first part of this chapter, Nonrefundable Credits, covers seven credits that 
you subtract directly from your tax. These credits may reduce your tax to zero. If these credits are more 
than your tax, the excess is not refunded to you. 
Refundable credits. The second part of this chapter, Refundable Credits, covers three credits that are 
treated as payments and are refundable to you. These credits are added to the federal  income  tax  
withheld and any estimated tax payments you made. If this total is more than your total tax, the excess 
will be refunded to you.

 528  •  Chapter 37: Other Credits
III. NONREFUNDABLE CREDITS 
ADOPTION CREDIT 
You may be able to take a tax credit of up to $16,810 for qualifying expenses paid to adopt an eligible 
child. The credit may be allowed for the adoption of a child with special needs even if you do not have 
any qualified expenses. 
If your modified adjusted gross income (AGI) is more than $252,150, your credit is reduced. If your 
modified AGI is $292,150 or more, you cannot claim the credit.
Qualified adoption expenses. Qualified adoption expenses are reasonable and necessary adoption 
fees, court costs, attorney fees, traveling expenses (including amounts spent for meals and lodging) 
while away from home, and other expenses directly related to, and whose principal purpose is for, the 
legal adoption of an eligible child. These expenses include:
• Adoption fees,
• Court costs,
• Attorney fees,
• Travel expenses (including amounts spent for meals and lodging) while away from home, 
and
• Re-adoption expenses to adopt a foreign child.
Nonqualified expenses. Qualified adoption expenses do not include expenses: 
• That violate state or federal law, 
• For carrying out any surrogate parenting arrangement, 
• For the adoption of your spouse’s child, 
• For which you received funds under any federal, state, or local program, 
• Allowed as a credit or deduction under any other federal income tax rule, or 
• Paid or reimbursed by your employer or any other person or organization. 
Eligible child. The term “eligible child” means any individual:  
1. Under 18 years old, or 
2. Physically or mentally incapable of caring for himself or herself.  
Child with special needs. An eligible child is a child with special needs if all three of the following apply:
1. The child was a citizen or resident of the United States (including U.S. possessions) at 
the time the adoption process began. 

 529  •  Chapter 37: Other Credits
2. A state (including the District of Columbia) determines that the child cannot or should not 
be returned to his or her parents’ home.
3. The state has determined that the child will not be adopted unless assistance is provided 
to the adoptive parents. Factors used by states to make this determination include: 
• The child’s ethnic background, 
• The child’s age,
• Whether the child is a member of a minority or sibling group, or 
• Whether the child has a medical condition or physical, mental, or emotional 
handicap. 
When  to  take  the  credit. Generally, until the adoption becomes final, you take the credit in the year 
after your qualified expenses are paid or incurred. If the adoption becomes final, you take the credit in 
the year your expenses were paid or incurred. 
Foreign child. If the child is not a U.S. citizen or resident, you cannot take the credit unless the adoption 
becomes final. You treat all adoption expenses paid or incurred in years before the adoption becomes 
final as paid or incurred in the year it becomes final. 
How to take the credit. Figure your 2024 nonrefundable credit and any carryforward to 2025 on Form 
8839 and attach it to your Form 1040 or 1040-SR. Include the credit in your total for Schedule 3 (Form 
1040), line 6c. 
CREDIT TO HOLDERS OF TAX CREDIT BONDS
Tax credit bonds are bonds in which the holder receives a tax credit in lieu of some or all of the interest 
on the bond.
You may be able to take a credit if you are a holder of one of the following bonds.
• Clean renewable energy bonds (issued before 2010).
• New clean renewable energy bonds.
• Qualified energy conservation bonds.
• Qualified school construction bonds.
• Qualified zone academy bonds.
• Build America bonds.
In some instances, an issuer may elect to receive a credit for interest paid on the bond. If the issuer 
makes this election, you cannot also claim a credit.
Interest income. The amount of any tax credit allowed (figured before applying tax liability limits) must 
be included as interest income on your tax return.

 530  •  Chapter 37: Other Credits
How to take the credit. Complete Form 8912 and attach it to your Form 1040 or 1040-SR. Include the 
credit in your total for Schedule 3 (Form 1040), line 6k. 
FOREIGN TAX CREDIT  
You generally can choose to claim income taxes you paid or accrued during the year to a foreign country 
or U.S. possession as a credit against your U.S. income tax. Or, you can deduct them as an itemized 
deduction (see chapter 23). 
You cannot take a credit (or deduction) for foreign income taxes paid on income that you exclude from 
U.S. tax under the foreign earned income exclusion, the foreign housing exclusion, income from Puerto 
Rico exempt from U.S. tax, or the possession exclusion. 
Limit on the credit. Unless you can elect not to file Form 1116, your foreign tax credit cannot be more 
than your U.S. tax liability (the total of Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 16, and Schedule 2 (Form 1040), line 
2) multiplied by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is your taxable income from sources outside the 
United States. The denominator is your total taxable income from U.S. and foreign sources. 
How to take the credit. Complete Form 1116 and attach it to your Form 1040 or 1040-SR. Enter the 
credit on Schedule 3 (Form 1040), line 1.
Exception
You do not have to complete Form 1116 to take the credit if all of the following apply.
1. All of your foreign source gross income was “passive category income” 
(which includes most interest and dividends) and all of that income 
and the foreign tax paid on it were reported to you on qualified payee 
statements, such as Form 1099-INT and Form 1099-DIV (or substitute 
statements).
2. The total of your foreign taxes was not more than $300 (not more than 
$600 if married filing jointly).
For more details on these requirements, see the instructions for Form 1116.
MORTGAGE INTEREST CREDIT 
The mortgage interest credit is intended to help lower-income individuals own a home. If you qualify, you 
can take a credit each year for part of the home mortgage interest you pay. 
Who qualifies. You may be eligible for the credit if you were issued a mortgage credit certificate (MCC) 
from your state or local government. Generally, an MCC is issued only in connection with a new mortgage 
for the purchase of your main home.

 531  •  Chapter 37: Other Credits
Amount of credit. Figure your credit on Form 8396. If your mortgage is equal to (or smaller than) the 
certified indebtedness amount (loan) shown on your MCC, enter on Form 8396, line 1, all the interest 
you paid on your mortgage during the year.
If your mortgage loan amount is larger than the certified indebtedness amount shown on your MCC, you 
can figure the credit on only part of the interest you paid. To find the amount to enter on line 1, multiply 
the total interest you paid during the year on your mortgage by the following fraction.
Certified indebtedness amount on your MCC 
Original amount of your mortgage
Limit  based  on  credit  rate. If the certificate credit rate is more than 20%, the credit you are allowed 
cannot be more than $2,000. If two or more persons (other than a married couple filing a joint return) 
hold an interest in the home to which the MCC relates, this $2,000 limit must be divided based on the 
interest held by each person. 
Carryforward. Your credit (after applying the limit based on the credit rate) is also subject to a limit 
based on your tax that is figured using Form 8396. If your allowable credit is reduced because of this 
tax liability limit, you can carry forward the unused portion of the credit to the next 3 years or until used, 
whichever comes first. 
If you are subject to the $2,000 limit because your certificate credit rate is more than 20%, you cannot 
carry forward any amount more than $2,000 (or your share of the $2,000 if you must divide the credit). 
How to take the credit. Figure your 2024 credit and any carryforward to 2025 on Form 8396, and attach 
it to your Form 1040 or 1040-SR. Be sure to carry any credit carryforward from 2021, 2022, and 2023.
Include the credit on Schedule 3 (Form 1040), line 6g.  
Reduced home mortgage interest deduction. If you claim the credit and itemize your deductions on 
Schedule A (Form 1040), you must reduce your home mortgage interest deduction by the amount of the 
mortgage interest credit shown on Form 8396, line 3. You must do this even if part of that amount is to 
be carried forward to 2025. 
Recapture of federal mortgage subsidy. If you received an MCC with your mortgage loan, you may 
have to recapture (pay back) all or part of the benefit you received from that program. The recapture 
may be required if you sell or dispose of your home at a gain during the first 9 years after the date you 
closed your mortgage loan. 
NONREFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR PRIOR YEAR MINIMUM TAX 
The tax laws give special treatment to some kinds of income and allow special deductions and credits 
for some kinds of expenses. If you benefit from these laws, you may have to pay at least a minimum 
amount of tax in addition to any other tax on these items. This is called the alternative minimum tax. 

 532  •  Chapter 37: Other Credits
The special treatment of some items of income and expenses only allows you to postpone paying tax 
until a later year. If in prior years you paid alternative minimum tax because of these tax postponement 
items, you may be able to claim a credit for prior year minimum tax against your current year’s regular

1. Had  an  alternative  minimum  tax  liability  and  adjustments  or  preferences  other  than 
exclusion items,
2. Had a minimum tax credit that you are carrying forward to 2024, or 
3. Had an unallowed qualified electric vehicle credit.  
How to take the credit. Figure your 2024 nonrefundable credit (if any) and any carryforward to 2024 
on Form 8801, and attach it to your Form 1040 or 1040-SR. Include the credit on Schedule 3 (Form

mutual funds) or real estate investment trusts (REITs) allocated to you as capital gain distributions, even 
if you did not actually receive them. If the mutual fund or REIT paid a tax on the capital gain, you are 
allowed a credit for the tax since it is considered paid by you. The mutual  fund  or  REIT  will  send  you  
Form 2439, Notice to Shareholder of Undistributed Long-Term Capital Gains, showing the undistributed 
capital gains and the tax paid, if any.

 534  •  Chapter 37: Other Credits
How to take the credit. To take the credit, attach Copy B of Form 2439 to your Form 1040 or 1040-SR. 
Include the amount from box 2 of your Form 2439 in the total for Schedule 3 (Form 1040), line 13a.
CREDIT  FOR  EXCESS  SOCIAL  SECURITY  TAX  OR  RAILROAD  RETIREMENT  TAX  
WITHHELD 
Most employers must withhold social security tax from your wages. If you work for a railroad employer, 
that employer must withhold tier 1 railroad retirement (RRTA) tax and tier 2 RRTA tax. 
If you worked for two or more employers in 2024, you may have had too much social security tax withheld 
from your pay. If one or more of those employers was a railroad employer, too much tier 1 RRTA tax 
may also have been withheld at the 6.2% rate. You can claim the excess social security or tier 1 RRTA 
tax as a credit against your income tax when you file your return. For the tier 1 RRTA tax, only use the 
portion of the tier 1 RRTA tax that was taxed at the 6.2% rate when figuring if excess tier 1 RRTA tax 
was withheld; do not include any portion of the tier 1 RRTA tax that was withheld at the Medicare tax rate 
(1.45%) or the Additional Medicare Tax rate (0.9%). The following table shows the maximum amount of 
wages subject to tax and the maximum amount of tax that should have been withheld for 2024.
Type of taxMaximum wages subject  
to tax
Maximum tax that should 
have been withheld
Social security or RRTA tier 1$168,600$10,453.20
RRTA tier 2$125,100  $6,129.90
Caution!
 
All wages are subject to Medicare tax withholding.
Tip
 
Use Form 843, Claim  for  Refund  and  Request  for  Abatement, to claim a refund of 
excess tier 2 RRTA tax. Be sure to attach a copy of all of your W-2 forms.
Employer’s error. If any one employer withheld too much social security or tier 1 RRTA tax, you cannot 
take the excess as a credit against your income tax. The employer should adjust the tax for you. If the 
employer does not adjust the overcollection, you can file a claim for refund using Form 843. 

 535  •  Chapter 37: Other Credits
Joint return. If you are filing a joint return, you cannot add the social security or tier 1 RRTA tax withheld 
from your spouse’s wages to the amount withheld from your wages. Figure the withholding separately 
for you and your spouse to determine if either of you has excess withholding. 
How to figure the credit if you did not work for a railroad. If you did not work for a railroad during 
2024, figure the credit as follows: 
1. Add all social security tax withheld (but not more than $10,453.20 for 
each employer). Enter the total here
 
______________
2. Enter  any  uncollected  social  security  tax  on  tips  or  group-term  life  
insurance included in the total on Schedule 2 (Form 1040), line 13,
